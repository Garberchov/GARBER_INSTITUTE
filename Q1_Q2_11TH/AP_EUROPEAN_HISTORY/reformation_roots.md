### Reformation Roots

#### The decline of Latin 
 - Throughout the middle ages, Average people spoke Latin to varying degrees. In no small part, it was dependent on just how powerful Rome had been in its occupation of your region. For example, Gaul, Hispania, Italy, and Dacia had all seen very heavy occupations by Roman soldiers and others. As a result, the daily speech of the people who lived there was heavily influenced by Latin. That is a large reason why people who now live on those aforementioned areas speak languages that are very similar to Latin. Called Romance languages, these languages are descended from Latin and include French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian.
 - However, all of these people were learning the language naturally, without the use of textbooks. As a result, differences began to emerge. These differences were in turn exacerbated as words from neighboring languages became commonplace. Within time, the transition from Latin to 'old' languages, like 'Old French' or 'Old Spanish' occurred, leaving people from different regions largely unable to speak to one another. In short, vernacular languages, or languages spoken by the masses, had been developed.
 - To be fair, none of that really mattered for the educated. The printing press effectively changed that. Writers sought new audiences for their work, and groups of people who didn't necessarily read Latin but could still make out all the letters' sounds were ideal candidates. It is partially for this reason that so many Middle and Early Modern English words have odd spellings - until this time, writing was something only really considered for Latin, so there was a period in which each writer tried to get across their idea using their own spelling guides.
 - This was the end of Latin as a language of the people. It was still used in the church, and in the courts, but it was no longer the language of the people. This was a huge change, and it was one that would have a profound effect on the development of the Reformation.

#### The Catholic Church before the Reformation
 - The Roman Catholic Church was a very powerful institution in the West that was involved in every aspect of people's lives from birth to death. The Church had this power primarily because Christians believed it alone held the keys to salvation. The Church taught that only those who did good works and received the sacraments could go to Heaven. Sacraments are the rites that bring people closer to God and give them grace. There are seven sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church: Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Reconciliation, Matrimony, Anointing of the Sick, and Holy Orders.
 - Baptism is the first of the seven sacraments a Christian needs to be saved. A baptism clanses of original sin, and they are now a member of the church. 
 - The bishop is the head of the diocese, which is made up of many parishes. The bishop is the one who performs the sacrament of Confirmation. This sacrament is the one that makes a person a full member of the church, and is given grace to live a full Christian life.
 - Eucharist is the sacrament that bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ. 
 - Reconciliation is the sacrament that absolves a person of their sins, most commonly through confession to a priest.
 - Anointing of the Sick is the sacrament that gives grace to the sick to help them through their illness.
 - Purgatory is the place where souls go to be cleansed of their sins before they can go to Heaven. It is never clear to a Christian how long they will be in Purgatory so they pray for as short a time as possible.
 - Matrimony is the sacrament that makes a marriage a sacrament.

#### Martin Luther
 - The dominance of the Roman Catholic Church remained unchallenged for nearly 500 years. Then, in 1517, a German priest shook the Catholic Church to its very foundations. His name was Martin Luther. Luther was not a rebel. He wasn't trying to destroy the Catholic Church or even start his own religion. All Luther was trying to do was to stop the Church from engaging in some practices that he considered unchristian.
 - Luther's problem was with the Church's practice of selling indulgences. An indulgence is a remission of punishment for sins. You can think of an indulgence as a 'get out of hell free' card. The church had been in the practice of granting indulgences in exchange for good works and acts of piety for centuries, ever since Pope Urban II offered indulgences to Crusaders in 1095.
 - Luther questioned whether the church had the authority to grant such indulgences. He believed that the only true path to salvation lay through faithfulness to Christ and his teachings, not through adherence to the ideologies and dogmas of the Catholic Church. Yet Luther probably would not have made a fuss if it weren't for the fact that these 'get out of hell free' cards weren't actually free.
 - To Luther's eyes, the Church was essentially selling salvation. He witnessed poor peasants giving up their life savings to buy an indulgence for a dead relative, in the hope of saving their loved ones from the tortures of purgatory. All the while the Church grew ever richer.
 - Luther saw nothing in the Bible that gave the Church the right to charge people for their salvation. The church was supposed to be a spiritual sanctuary, not a marketplace.
 - So, Luther set about writing 95 complaints with the Church's greedy behavior. These complaints are now called the 95 Theses. On October 31, 1517, Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the Church of Wittenberg and sent copies to the higher authorities of the Catholic Church.
 - The posting of the 95 Theses is considered by many the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. However, it is important to remember that Luther was not trying to undermine the Church. He was just trying to get them to stop making money off the business of salvation.
 - Luther's 95 Theses spread across Europe like wildfire. Within two months, they were being read in cities across the continent. The next year, they were translated into German and printed on a massive scale, further fueling the controversy. Luther suddenly found himself at the center of the greatest conflict of his age.
 - Yet the Church was not done with Luther. The Church decided to hand Luther over to the greatest secular authority in Germany, the Holy Roman Empire. In 1521, Martin Luther was summoned to the Diet of Worms, a conference of both religious and secular leaders held in Worms, Germany. Once again, Luther was commanded to recant his heresy. He refused and was order arrested, but he escaped and fled to Wartburg Castle, where he spent the next year in hiding.
 - Not content to hide on the sidelines, Luther made good use of his exile. He spent his year at Wartburg writing various letters and treatises attacking the Catholic Church. His greatest achievement of the time was his translation of the Bible into German.
 - Luther held the Bible as the highest authority, higher even than the papacy. He realized that so long as people could not read the Bible, they would continue to fall for the deceptions of Catholic ideology. Luther's supporters smuggled his translation out, and soon printing presses across Germany were cranking out copies of Luther's Bible. The publication had the desired effect.
 - All across Germany, people started reading the Bible and began challenging the authority of the Church. In fact, things started getting a little out of hand.
 - When Luther returned to Wittenberg in 1522, he found the populace in nearly full-scale revolt. The mob was being whipped up by a set of radical zealots known as the Zwickau Prophets. Luther drove the Zwickau out of Wittenberg and settled down to reestablish law and order. He founded his own Lutheran Church in Wittenberg in 1526.
 - Meanwhile, the Zwickau spread across Germany, burning churches, monasteries, bishop's palaces, and libraries, often in Luther's name. The Zwickau were determined to use Luther's treatment by the Church and state as a rallying point for their revolution, regardless of Luther's feelings on the matter.
 - This uprising, which became known as the Peasants' Revolt, was but the beginning of about five centuries of nearly unending bloodshed. The Protestant Reformation swept across Europe, spreading first to the Netherlands, then to France and England. Soon all of Northern Europe was in the throes of religious warfare as Protestants fought Catholics for the soul of Europe.
