### Influences on the constitution

The Constitution of the United States of America, a document which inspires much criticism and politically motivated anger in the modern day has had impacts far greater than just the domestic political situation it prescribes. The worldwide affects of the document has laid the groundwork for democracies across the world and been a shining light for individual freedoms during periods of the darkness of fascism and dictatorship. However, the founding fathers did not come up with the structure of the nation they fought for in a vacuum. Several prominent figures in the creation of the Constitution were influenced by a number of outside sources, and the views and opinions of these sources are clearly reflected in the governmental system that the Constitution created. The most notable of these influences include the English Magna Carta, The Iroquois Confederacy, John Locke and the Baron de Montesquieu.
