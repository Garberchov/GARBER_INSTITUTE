### Magna Carta Influences on the Constitution 

The Constitution of the United States of America, a document that inspires much criticism and politically motivated anger in the modern day, has had greater impacts than just the domestic political situation it prescribes. The worldwide effects of the document have laid the groundwork for democracies across the world and been a shining light for individual freedoms during periods of the darkness of fascism and dictatorship. However, the founding fathers did not come up with the structure of the nation they fought for in a vacuum. Prominent figures in the creation of the Constitution were influenced by many outside sources, the most notable of these being the English Magna Carta which served as a foundation for the rights of the individual during the early days of colonization and was amplified to a quintessential spirit of American Individualism which was manifested in the Constitution.

Magna Carta, quite fittingly, "Great Charter" is a royal charter that prescribes the rights of an individual; originally instituted by being forced upon King John of England to ensure peace between the deeply unpopular king and the numerous groups fighting against him. While the original agreements of Magna Carta were not followed by either party for long, in the 16th century as the push for the rights of the individual increased in fervor it was revived as the legal foundation for Parliament despite historical misconceptions about its actual contents and beginnings. Magna Carta was not something King John desired, instead being forced upon him to prevent the expansion of civil war across his nation and only coincidentally contained the basis for modern individual rights. 

The influence of Magna Carta on the United States extended far before the writing of the Constitution, as several Royal Charters for the colonization of what would later become the American colonies had the foundational contents of Magna Carta in them, beginning American's view that they had a fundamental right to due process, an issue which would prove critical in the decision to rebel against Britain. The belief that the Magna Carta was a fundamental law of humanity that ensured individual rights was readily accepted by Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, who called upon congress to implement Magna Carta's foundational concepts such as the right to a fair and speedy trial, protection from fines exceeding what can be paid, the right to individual ownership of property, and the right to representation in exchange for taxation into the Constitution. These concepts are the direct forbearer to the push for a Bill of Rights, an Anti-Federalist demand for the ratification of the new Constitution.

In conclusion, Magna Carta was a stunningly influential document in the creation of American Democracy and was a guiding light that closed the gap between the Federalist and Anti-Federalist causes in the agreement upon a Bill of Rights. Without the influence of Magna Carta, the final direction of the Constitution would have been far less certain, so a debt of gratitude from every America must be given to a document coming from the same nation America rebelled against to gain her freedom.
