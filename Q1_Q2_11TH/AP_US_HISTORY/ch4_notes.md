#### Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill
 - Following the Boston Tea Party and the passing of the Coercive Acts, General Thomas Gage a man familiar with warfare in the colonies was sent back to Massachusets as Military Governor. 
 - he got wind of a planned revolt in the countryside around Boston, he was ordered to carry out a top-secret plan to destroy the weapons that the Massachusetts militia was stockpiling in a little town called Concord and then arrest the men who seemed to be the biggest troublemakers: Sam Adams and John Hancock
 - The militia in Concord had moved the weapons to safety long before the date of the raid. So on April 19, 1775, the colonists couldn't be absolutely sure that the British would go to Concord, and if they did, how they would get there and how many troops there would be. They planned a secret method of communicating the information once it was available. If the army was leaving Boston over land, the Patriots would light one lamp in the bell tower of the Old North Church.
 - Thousands of men headed to Concord. In the village of Lexington, about 70 local men and teenagers assembled in the village commons to slow the advance of a thousand deadly British regulars while a few hundred onlookers watched from the outskirts. Their captain told them 'Stand your ground; don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.'
 - The British regulars tried to intimidate the militia and hold a strategic bridge to prevent them from unifying. But American knowledge of the land and a significant manpower advantage allowed the militia to inflict hundreds of casualties on the British troops. Their hasty and disorganized retreat to Boston was even worse. They took heavy fire from militia hidden in trees, behind fences and along the roads, suffering many more casualties, including all but one of their officers, before they were rescued by a reinforcement of another thousand British soldiers from Boston.

 - Before dawn on May 10, 1775, the fort and its armory were taken without firing a shot. Arnold was encouraged to push the American army farther into Canada, but an attempted invasion of Quebec was a humiliating defeat
 - Technically, the Congress had no authority to pass binding resolutions, but in the spirit of republicanism, the colonists gave them their legitimacy, and as time passed and the conflict intensified, the Congress asserted more and more authority. One of their most important early actions was to name George Washington, a trained, experienced British officer, as the commander of the Continental Army,
 - The Americans had the high ground but had fewer men and little ammunition. Under now-famous orders, 'Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes,' the first British lines up the hill suffered heavy losses. But there were more British soldiers than American bullets.
 - Technically, the British won the battle when the militia ran out of ammunition, but not before nearly a thousand British soldiers were dead or wounded, including 92 officers - more British casualties than any other single battle of the war. They secured both Bunker and Breed's Hills, but the costly win did not help them break the siege, which lasted 11 months.
 

#### The Second Continental Congress, Common Sense
 - Though Washington volunteered to lead the Continental Army without pay, the army would still need to be supplied with food and ammunition. So, Congress agreed to print Continental Currency - a violation of the 1774 Currency Act - and borrowed money from wealthy colonists and foreign banks. They authorized the Committee of Secret Correspondence to initiate diplomatic relations with foreign governments, like France (who aided the rebels secretly for a while), and to conduct covert intelligence operations in the colonies and abroad.
 - Despite these obvious war preparations, the Second Continental Congress went to great lengths to pledge their loyalty to Great Britain as long as they were granted full rights. They sent the Olive Branch Petition on July 8, 1775. This letter insisted that the colonies wanted to negotiate trade and tax regulations with Great Britain, not gain independence.
 - He brought in Hessian mercenaries to squash the escalating revolt. This was a slap in the face to the colonists. Why would the King send freelance German soldiers to control British citizens? This action helped strengthen the position of the radicals who were calling for independence. Finally, in May of 1776, Congress passed a resolution that really was treasonous; they overthrew royal governments where they existed in the colonies and set up new Patriot governments.
 - In January 1776, Thomas Paine released a pamphlet titled Common Sense. Using the emotional, Biblical arguments and progressive style of logic employed by preachers of the Great Awakening, Paine made the case that America needed to rebel against British rule. Considering how many people lived in the colonies at the time, Common Sense was more widely distributed than any book in American history
 - On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted in favor of independence, though not unanimously. Benjamin Franklin famously encouraged all of the delegates to vote in favor of independence by saying 'We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.'
 - During the American Revolution, colonists like Benjamin Franklin who supported republicanism and eventually, independence, came to be known as Patriots. Historians estimate that about 40-45% of white men were patriots. Those men who chose to continue supporting the king, like William Franklin, were called Loyalists, or Tories. They made up about 15-20% of the white male population. The last 35-45% never publicly chose sides.
 - Just like political affiliations today, loyalists, patriots, and neutrals came from all social and economic classes, and many people took sides based not on principle but on who they thought was going to win or which side would profit them the most personally. But then, as now, there were demographic trends.
 - There was another large segment of the population that had definite opinions, but no political voice, notably women, African-Americans, and Native Americans. Married women generally chose the same side as their husbands. But a divided household (when a patriot woman's husband was a loyalist) was legal grounds for divorce. Native Americans who chose a side tended to be Loyalists, since the Proclamation Line had demonstrated Britain's willingness to respect their interests.
