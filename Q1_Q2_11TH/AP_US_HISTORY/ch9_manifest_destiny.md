### Manifest Destiny

#### The Oregon Trail
 - In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, both the British and Americans explored and claimed territory in the Pacific Northwest, an area that came to be known to Americans as the Oregon Country. After the 1818 Rush-Bagot Treaty reached a joint occupancy agreement, thousands of settlers crossed overland to the new territory. Stretching 2,000 miles from Missouri to the Pacific Coast, the Oregon Trail was blazed by fur trappers like John Jacob Astor as a footpath. But within a couple of decades, the wagon trail included bridges and mountain passes, taking nearly half a million people not just to Oregon but to many 'jumping-off points,' leading prospectors to California, Mormon refugees to Utah and settlers anywhere there was fertile land, displacing thousands of Native Americans in the process.
 - In 1845, journalist John O'Sullivan defended America's claim on the territory, saying, '…that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.' A lot of people agreed with him.
 - Some saw expansion as a matter of national defense - they were concerned about increased British or Mexican influence in North America. Others wanted to occupy as much territory in North America as possible for economic reasons and secure ports to Asia on the West Coast. Some wanted to expand the reach and influence of slavery into new places.
 - Another motive was land. A baby boom plus dramatic increases in immigration more than quadrupled the population between the turn of the century and 1850, and all those people needed somewhere to go. Then economic downturns occurred in both 1818 and 1839. The frontier offered people a second chance with new opportunities in business and cheap (or even free) land. Land ownership represented freedom, wealth and political power. And new technology such as steam power and the telegraph made the prospect of moving westward a little less intimidating. About 4,000,000 people (more than the population of the 13 colonies during the Revolution) moved west between 1820 and 1850.

#### The Texas Issue
 - In 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain. Almost immediately the new nation was embroiled in civil war, and Native American tribes fought for control of the less-populated Northeastern region. Obviously, Mexico had difficulty attracting settlers into the Northeast. To solve this problem, they loosened their immigration standards and encouraged Americans to settle in the area, known today as Texas.
 - The Republic of Texas was established as a sovereign nation. But ironically, the first elected president of Texas, Sam Houston, ran on a platform seeking annexation into the United States. U. S. President Andrew Jackson, not wanting to deal with the slave question, ignored Texas for a year. Then, on the day before he left office, he officially recognized the Republic. Later in 1837, newly-inaugurated President Martin Van Buren flat-out declined the Texas proposal for statehood, fearing that it would lead to war with Mexico. His successor, William Henry Harrison, died before taking any action.
 - When President Harrison died in 1841, Vice President John Tyler acceded to the office. As it happened, President Tyler was a slave owner who supported Western expansion and, in particular, annexation of Texas. He entered secret negotiations with the Republic and started a public relations campaign to drum up popular support. Evidence suggests that it was Tyler's own administration that started the rumors about Britain's plot to end slavery in America. Regardless, when Tyler brought the treaty before the Senate, it was defeated, and so was Tyler.
 - In the presidential campaign of 1844, James Polk took advantage of the rumors, urging Southerners to defend the institution of slavery and urging Northerners to resist British interference in domestic affairs. He promised to seek statehood for both Texas and the Oregon Territory (providing both slave and free states). Texas was annexed by a joint resolution of Congress after the election but before Polk actually took office. Congress passed the resolution, and Texas finally became the 28th state on December 29, 1845. Oregon statehood followed in 1859.

#### John Tyler
 - He had returned to state politics after voting against the Missouri Compromise, becoming a popular governor of Virginia. But his state legislature sent him back to Washington in 1827 as a senator. By this time, the Democratic-Republican Party had splintered; Tyler sided with the Democrats and Andrew Jackson, who held similar views on issues, like the national bank. But he got in trouble with the party leadership after condemning Jackson's unprincipled actions, like granting government positions to political supporters and using executive order to accomplish his goals. Tyler resigned his senate seat rather than be forced to choose between his principles or the Democrats that had elected him. This put him in the uneasy position of aligning with the anti-Jacksonian Whig Party under the leadership of Henry Clay
 - In the 1840 presidential election, the Whig Party was looking for a ticket to defeat incumbent President Martin Van Buren. They chose William Henry Harrison - the old hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe - as their candidate. John Tyler seemed like a perfect running mate, even though he never endorsed the Whig platform, since he could draw Southern votes away from the Democratic Party. With one of the most memorable political slogans ever created, 'Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!' were successful. And as planned, President Harrison was little more than a puppet for Henry Clay for all of his 30 days in office.
 - President Harrison, after delivering a two-hour inaugural address in a freezing cold rain, contracted pneumonia and died, leaving the nation to face a new Constitutional crisis: Does the vice president actually become the president, or does he just fulfill the duties of the office? Tyler believed it was the former, asked to take the oath of office and gave an inaugural address. Ironically, John Tyler became America's tenth president in 1841 under the same circumstances as his first federal office, prompting his opponents to secretly call him 'His Accidency.' But Henry Clay found that Tyler wouldn't be so easy to dominate as Harrison had been. Thus began a contentious one-term presidency that split the political parties along sectional lines and led the nation even closer to the Civil War.
 - At first, Tyler signed several pieces of Whig legislation, including the Log Cabin Bill that gave squatters first rights to buy federal land at low prices. But then Henry Clay, the leader of his own party, presented Tyler with a number of banking bills, knowing he would veto them. It was an attempt to discredit Tyler in the next election, which Clay hoped to win. Next, Clay convinced all of the cabinet but one, Daniel Webster, to resign on September 11, 1841, hoping that Tyler himself would then resign. He did not, and President Tyler was officially kicked out of the Whig Party.
 - For all of his problems in Washington, Tyler did manage some foreign policy accomplishments, including international trade agreements with China and Germany. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty resolved a long-standing border dispute between Canada and Maine, and the Seminole War was finally brought to an end. But the platform that was most important to President Tyler was expansion, and though he doesn't get much credit for it (or blame, depending how you look at it), he actually made important strides toward Manifest Destiny, America's goal of stretching over the entire continent. The navy was increased significantly, Florida became a state and he took steps toward annexing Hawaii.

#### The Mexican American War
 - The Mexican-American War started in 1846, but its story really begins a quarter of a century earlier. In 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain. The country was in debt to both its own citizens and Britain. Mexico enticed American citizens into immigrating into the northeastern part of the country, known today as Texas. Mexico had a series of internal battles, and the residents of Texas, most of whom were English-speaking, seceded. In 1836, Texas defeated Mexican General Santa Anna and declared its independence.
 - But Polk couldn't live with ''no'' for an answer. This time, he sent a different kind of negotiator: General Zachary Taylor. The army occupied the disputed land southwest of the Nueces, angering not only the Mexican government but many American citizens as well. When a few soldiers were killed in a skirmish, Polk told Congress that Mexico had shed American blood on American soil. On May 13, 1846, Congress approved the Mexican-American War, but America was deeply divided over the issue. Opponents called it Polk's War.
 - Whigs, like then-Captain Ulysses S. Grant, accused the President of provoking an unjust war against a weaker neighbor—a concept that contradicted the romantic ideals of Manifest Destiny in which democracy would spread because of its own virtue. Abraham Lincoln doubted the provocation and demanded to know the exact spot where American soldiers had been killed. Abolitionists opposed going to war with Mexico because they feared the expansion of slavery. But even some Southern slave owners opposed the war because they did not want people of color admitted to the Union.
 0 The court of public opinion was just as divided. An expedited route of information between New York and New Orleans newspapers used the latest technology—the telegraph—to send back glorified details of the heroic actions of General Taylor and his soldiers. The Mexican government had overestimated its ability to fight a war against America, and its forces faced repeated routs and losses of territory.
 - In reality, it wasn't always good news, but the American media loved to make it seem that way. As the penny press reprinted stories of victory after victory, the public split into two camps: those who saw America as a bully pummeling a weaker neighbor and those who saw an opportunity to take all of Mexico. An essay by the famous transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau persuaded many American citizens to stop paying their taxes in protest. ''Civil Disobedience'' landed Thoreau in jail.
 - Although President Polk had officially recalled his diplomat from Mexico City, Nicholas Trist proceeded with negotiations. And since the terms were favorable, Polk sent the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo to the Senate for ratification. The main provision of the treaty was America's right to buy about half of Mexico's land (the territories of California and New Mexico) for $15 million. This land has come to be known as the Mexican cession. Additionally, the U.S. would assume $3.25 million in debts owed to U.S. citizens in exchange for settling the Texas border at the Rio Grande.

#### Election of 1848 & California Gold Rush
 - Even though the Mexican-American War had been controversial, Americans were feeling pretty good about the Democrats and all the new territory President Polk had added. But Polk had promised during the election of 1844 that he would not seek a second term. In his place, the Democrats nominated Michigan Senator Lewis Cass, who had endorsed popular sovereignty for the Mexican cession. Frustrated over his pro-slavery leanings, prominent anti-slavery Democrats stomped out of the nominating convention and formed the Free Soil party with Martin Van Buren as their candidate
 -Even though the Democratic Party had fractured, they seemed assured a presidential victory because of surging nationalism following the war. Knowing they needed to take advantage of this tide rather than fight it, the Whigs once again passed over Henry Clay and chose war hero General Zachary Taylor as their candidate. The fact that he was a slaveholder appealed to Southerners, but his 40 years of national military service made him stand in opposition to sectionalism and states' rights, which was a plus for Northerners. Taylor eked out a victory in the 3-way race.
 -Earlier in 1848, California was part of the land added to the U.S. in the Mexican cession, but the debate over slavery had stalled any decision-making about organizing the territory as far as Americans were concerned. It was a difficult time for the former Mexican residents and one Californian seemed to be at the end of his luck.
 -Just a week before the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was finalized, Marshall was inspecting the creek as it left Sutter's Mill and saw something shiny. He said, 'I picked up one or two pieces and examined them attentively, and having some general knowledge of minerals, I could not call to mind more than two which in any way resembled this--sulphuret of iron, very bright and brittle; and gold, bright, yet malleable. I then tried it between two rocks, and found that it could be beaten into a different shape, but not broken.' As it turns out, the metal that James Marshall found in Sutter's Mill was gold.
 - At first Sutter and Marshall tried to keep it a secret. Unfortunately, neither of them knew much about mining, so Sutter hired some men to work for him. These employees were more successful than they let on - stealing most of the gold and spending it around town. This got the attention of a local newspaper publisher who proclaimed to the world that there was gold in Sutter's Mill. Marshall and Sutter were literally forced off the land by the influx of people. Before the gold rush subsided in a few years, 300,000 prospectors from nearly every continent had overrun California. Short of sending in the army against its own people, there was nothing the federal government could do to stop them.
 - In 1849 alone, the rush of nearly 90,000 so-called 'forty-niners' brought California's rural ranching lifestyle to an abrupt end. Tiny San Francisco, with its deep-water port, became the landing point for half of the prospectors from around the world, growing from a settlement of 200 people to a booming metropolis of nearly 35,000 in 1850. The arrival of families meant the development of towns and roads, schools and protestant churches

#### President Fillmore
 - Congress had actually been fighting over Mexican land long before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo even existed. At one side of the debate, David Wilmot proposed banning all slavery, all indentured servants, and basically, all black residents from the land. The Wilmot Proviso repeatedly passed the House of Representatives, since the northern states were more populated, but it could not pass the Senate with its careful balance of slave and free states. At the other end of the debate were southerners, like John C. Calhoun, who wanted to ensure that slavery, which he had famously defended in an 1832 speech as a 'positive good,' was guaranteed forever.
 - Before his death, President Taylor suggested the new land fast-track through the territorial stage and just write the state constitutions. This famous political cartoon shows him in a very precarious position over the issue of slavery in California.
 - Henry Clay, nicknamed the 'Great Compromiser' after his proposal in 1820, could see that the north and south were ready to split. Finally, in January 1850, the 70-year old Kentucky Senator presented Congress with a new compromise bill. Together with two other senior statesmen (Daniel Webster from Massachusetts and John Calhoun from South Carolina), Henry Clay convinced Congress that no matter their differences, the nation was stronger if they stuck together. A new, young leader, named Stephen Douglas, championed their cause when the elder Senators were too ill to attend. When Zachary Taylor died, President Millard Fillmore threw his support behind the compromise and helped secure its passage. It took eight months to hammer out the details, and in the end, it couldn't prevent a Civil War, but for the time being, the Compromise of 1850 held the nation together.


#### Franklin Pierce
 - Although America seemed peaceful on the surface following the Compromise of 1850, the national conventions leading up to the 1852 presidential election showed otherwise. Southern Whigs favored the incumbent president, Millard Fillmore. But northern Whigs felt the Compromise had been a sell-out, which they blamed on Fillmore. It took 53 ballots, but finally, the Whigs settled on General Winfield Scott, a hero from the Mexican-American War. It was a strategy that had worked for them in the past.
 - The Democrats faced the same divisive issue. After 34 votes, four different men surfaced as front-runners. Finally, someone introduced a new name: Franklin Pierce. The Democrats liked that he was a northern man with southern sympathies. He was also a Brigadier General of the Mexican-American War (though this fact was downplayed). The fact that he was a so-called 'dark horse' was also considered a good thing, since that strategy had worked in their favor in the recent past. President Franklin Pierce won an electoral landslide, but it wouldn't take long for him to alienate many Americans and push the nation to the brink of war.
 - After the election, but before his inauguration, the Pierce family was in a train accident in which their 11-year old son died. Bennie had been the last of the president's surviving children, and both of his parents moved into the White House exhausted with grief. The president poured his nervous energy into economic and territorial expansion for the nation, noting that it was in America's national security interests to claim more land - and that he would not be restrained by 'any timid forebodings of evil from expansion.' Among his few non-controversial actions was opening diplomatic relations with Japan, hoping that open trade would follow. He also expanded trade with Canada and moved the U.S. closer to acquiring Hawaii. But from the outset, Northerners were suspicious and refused to be distracted from what seemed like his obvious intention to expand slave power.
 - Then, his Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis, convinced him to buy a strip of land at the southern border of the New Mexico territory for $10 million. With the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, Franklin Pierce completed the remaining contiguous territory of the United States - often called the 'lower 48.' Though the land was intended to be used as a route for the transcontinental railroad, it angered northerners both for its price tag and for its expansion of southern territory.
 - In the following year, Senator Stephen Douglas would compete to get the transcontinental railroad through land he owned and reignite the firestorm of slavery with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Violence erupted between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers in the territory after popular sovereignty was established. Pierce did little to address this problem. Also in 1854, the Ostend Manifesto was leaked. This letter, from some of his diplomats, revealed to the world that Pierce had attempted to buy Cuba (ostensibly to become a new slave state), and that he should consider military action if Spain refused to sell the land.
