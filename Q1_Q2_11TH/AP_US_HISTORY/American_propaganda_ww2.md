Propaganda is an essential part of warfare both for maintaining stability and productivity on the home-front, an essential requirement for the successful prosecution of a war, and for the motivation of troops in the conditions of war. This was no less true for the United States during World War 2 following their entry in 1941, as motivating the American people that fighting was worth it when defeating the unstoppable war machines of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan looked impossible. Propaganda efforts were necessary for the motivation of the whole American populous, but the most notable examples of notable targeted campaigns were done to direct driven fighting aged men towards the most innovative branches, and towards women and African Americans: groups which historically had been denied a fair chance to serve their country. 

The American populous, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was more willing to become embroiled in the conflicts that had fully spanned the globe then at any point since their entry into the First World War but there were still large portions of the population that believed that they should not be involved in the war in Europe in any respect. Despite Germany's declaration of war on the United States in accordance with the Tripartite pact signed by Japan, Germany and Italy, the United States had no requirement to be fully involved in a European war and it was only with a concerted campaign to change the mind of Americans that a case could be made for a full scale conflict with the most powerful military in the world. Thus, the widespread circulation of propaganda vulcanizing the German and Japanese leadership and their people as bloodthirsty creatures helped to inspire a genuine hatred of their enemies in the minds of the American people. This is well shown in the cartoon of Adolf Hitler and Hideki Tojo holding weapons and peering at the United States in the propaganda poster publicized by General Motors to inspire greater production in light of fears of an impending invasion of the United States.

Propaganda directly focused on the motivation of fighting men, both to encourage voluntary enlistment and to inspire those already enlisted has been a part of wartime strategy for millennia. However, with the United States espousing a new kind of warfare in the Second World War, the need for propaganda to inspire those fighting men with an acceptance towards new means of warfare - specifically in rapidly advancing areas like mobile and air warfare - adaptable, intelligent, enthusiastic fighting men were needed. These were areas in their infancy with tactics and ways of thinking about their role constantly being developed and without a fresh set of both fighting men and leaders they could never be utilized to their full potential. This is well seen with on recruiting posters for the Army Air Forces-the precursor to the Air Force- showing how a special message, more focused on the individuals they were recruiting instead of the numbers was used for this purpose. The design of the recruiting poster is also a good example of the different requirements of serving in mobile or airborne forces, both of which are small teams operating highly specialized equipment - the title, "The Greatest Team In The World!" speaks to that. This poster has the dual effect of selecting for those interested in being a part of a new way of fighting wars, and enshrining a sense of superiority in their method of fighting in the hearts of the American people.
