#### Response
 - The Monroe Doctrine was a landmark in foreign policy development for the fledgling United States coming after the War of 1812 that elevated the US to a position of political power on the world stage and entrench it against the Old World. James Monroe, the Fifth President of the United States and the man for whom the doctrine is named, first articulated it during his Seventh State of the Union Address and he declared that the United States would be taking an active role in ensuring that Spanish Colonies revolting from their empire would now be considered within the United States sphere of influence. Two prime examples of the American use of the Monroe Doctrine in the early parts of the 19th century were the disregarding of British control of the Falkland Islands and the diplomatic, not military, support of Gran Columbia under Simon Bolivar.
 - While it is oxymoronic to say that the Monroe Doctrine, a foreign policy implement largely enacted to ensure American dominance over the Western Hemisphere without interference from Old World Masters was used in allowing the British to control the Falkland Islands, in a larger geopolitical sense it becomes the logical conclusion. While The Monroe Doctrine was an ultimately successful attempt to raise the stature of the United States on the world stage, it was still not the first-tier naval power in any sense and thus had little ability to enforce these goals. By disregarding the Doctrine and allowing the British to retake the Falkland Islands from the Argentinians, the British Navy was now able to patrol the Southern Atlantic Ocean more, protecting American shipping and economic interests and expanding American ability to trade effectively with newly independent South American nations.
 - The diplomatic support of Simon Bolivar in his attempts to form Gran Colombia, a South American "super state" spanning across current-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama with strong Republican foundations and some major civil rights advancements was the most notable direct diplomatic use of The Monroe Doctrine in the early 19th century. James Monroe, while still President, took pride in becoming the first major power in the world to have official diplomatic contact with Gran Colombia and several other newly independent South American States. While the United States had neither the inclination nor the ability to militarily assist Bolivar, they were more than willing to establish extensive trade relations with the geographically close nation with a large population and extensive agricultural industries. This once again points to The Monroe Doctrine has the twin goals of promoting American diplomatic power on the world stage while simultaneously greatly improving the American economic position in the Western Hemisphere.
