What elements from each are the most useful to accomplishing the goal of international cooperation? Can such an organization be successful and what would that look like? 
#### Response:

#### Response:

The years immediately following World War 2 did not include an era of international peace and cooperation as many had hoped. The United States, with democratic, capitalist allies, and the Soviet Union were locked in a vicious struggle over the merits of their ideologies. The Cold War was a time of great fear and paranoia, with each side accusing the other of being a threat to world peace. The Soviet Union's expansion into Eastern Europe, and the United States' involvement in the Korean War and Vietnam War, only served to further fuel the fear and paranoia of the Cold War. In 1949, in response to the Soviet Union's expansion into Eastern Europe, in direct opposition to promises of free elections in liberated countries, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was founded. NATO was founded by the United States, Canada, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, and Iceland. NATO was founded on the principle of mutual defense, wherein if one nation was attacked by any other a collective response from all nations to the aggressor was required. The European Union(EU) was founded not in search of military protection but economic cooperation to help rebuild the brutalized economies of Europe, starting as the European Coal and Steel Community. This organization eliminated almost all trade barriers between member nations - supercharging the economies and industries of these nations and making war between them less likely, with the belief that nations who had intertwined economies wouldn't go to war with each other. In 1958, this was expanded to become the European Economic Community and later founded the European Parliament. The United Nations is the successor to the League of Nations, the doomed institution founded after World War I to ensure that another war of that scale did not happen again, however, due to a lack of cooperation from major powers it was not successful. Founded after World War II, the United Nations was chartered to ensure that conflicts could be mediated and resolved peacefully, instead of another World War that could prove the last the world would get a chance to fight. All of these organizations were founded to ensure that a repeat of the world wars of the first half of the 20th century would not be repeated, but they all tried to solve that problem in different ways. The differing strategic and ideological goals of these organization means that some facets of their operations are more useful in the maintenance of world peace. 

A discussion of the relative merits of these systems is incomplete without first acknowledging the differences in structure and ideology of these organizations. The European Union is a regional bloc for cultural and economic integration to assert European influence on the world stage as one organization, not many small nations without the diplomatic weight to be relevant. The United Nations is quite the opposite, having only minor administrative powers in favor of being the diplomatic meeting point for all nations(with minor exceptions). It was founded under the belief that an open meeting point to settle the questions of the day without resorting to armed conflict. While several sub-organizations with humanitarian and technological goals do exist, the central reason for being of the United Nations is to ensure open lines of communication between the nations of the world. Finally, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) is a strictly military and diplomatic alliance to preserve democracy. Originally founded in opposition to the Soviet Union, in the modern era, it functions as a deterrent to attacks on non-democratic governments on the members of the alliance and works to counter the influence of non-democratic nations. With different structures to represent their divergent strategic and international goals, it is no surprise that there are different components of each organization that are more useful in the maintenance of world peace and global cooperation. Notably, NATO's combined command structure and policy of collective defense, the European Union's elimination of barriers to trade and movement, and the United Nations' open diplomatic proceedings and home for all nations are critical in fostering international cooperation. If combined in a singular organization, these elements would lead to the unity of the world, and a brighter future for humanity.

The United Nations has a mixed reputation in the modern day, both are admired for the powerful ideals the organization espouses but also seen as a failure for not being able to enforce those ideals. The United Nations is a powerful organization, but the lack of real control over its members is a failure in execution that has led to fewer consequences for nations that have made oppression a policy.  The United Nations' failure to stop the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a prime example of this, in the words of Dr. Aldo Zammit Borda of City University of London, "In the run-up to this 'operation' and its early days, there was a palpable sense of resignation on the part of the other permanent members of the Security Council that Ukraine would fall into Russian hands. The sense was that maintaining international peace and security appeared to require, in this case, an allowance for Russia to occupy Ukraine â€“ even though this was in flagrant breach of international law." This resignation to unabashed aggression is so fragrantly in contrast to the founding document of the UN that it becomes clear the organization is not able to fulfill its stated mission. The first words of the UN charter read, "We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind," how they could do anything but full-throatily oppose the Russian invasion of Ukraine is tantamount to cowardice. However, if the tides inside the organization were to change - something that seems more likely with Russia's fall from grace in the face of a courageous Ukrainian defense - the UN could be a powerful force for good in the world. If the UN could demand accountability from its members, in the same way, that the EU does, it could be a powerful force for greater cooperation across the world. 

NATO is a political hot-button in many member countries, due to the required monetary contribution for defense however the power of the policy of collective defense and the coordinated military actions make the benefits of the alliance enormous in the face of aggressors. NATO's actions in support of Ukrainian sovereignty have been considerable, and have reenergized the alliance both in their actions militarily, and economically to dramatically decrease Russia's ability to continue high-tempo actions. Military deterrents to Russia in attacks against any NATO member countries, or the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine have reached a fever pitch, in the words of Sean Monaghan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "There are now 40,000 forces from all allies under the direct command of NATO, concentrated in Eastern Europe. These are supported by air and naval forces positioned from the High North to the Mediterranean Sea, including an unprecedented five carrier strike groups." This historic military and diplomatic unity from a group of nations who had been near fracturing over the past decade is a testament to the power of NATO's collective defense policy, as well as the power of the organization to act as a unified force in the face of absolute evil.

The European Union is the world's greatest supranational state and a model of multinational cooperation for the betterment of humanity. While gridlock, factionalism, and a largely desultory parliamentary system have dampened belief in the possibilities of the European Union, the possibilities of supranational integration offered by a united Europe are a model for the possibilities of a united world. The main cause of so-called 'euro skepticism' that has flooded the continent in recent years is a perceived inability of the European Parliament to act as a unified body. In the words of Zainab Batul Naqvi, whose paper *A Critical Discussion of the European Parliament's Evolution as an Institution of the EU* delves deeply into some of the most critical administrative issues of the European Parliament, "The power to initiate legislation, although associated with the legislative organ of a State is in practice enjoy by the executive. This is mirrored at the EU level as the Commission enjoys a monopoly on the right to formulate and initiate EU legislative proposals. The EP(European Parliament) and Council are therefore constrained as they may not act under their own initiative when legislating." This is a critical problem in a modern world with destabilizing threats, economically, militarily, and politically arising across the world and legislation is a key form of decisive action. Without a decisive ability to act, other powers on the world stage as well as voters lose faith in the EU's ability to act in support of its ideals and thus lose any mandate for its ideals.

With the individual facets of these organizations considered, the potential form of a future organization devoted to a new era of cooperation across the world starts to become clear. Expecting the almost total membership of the UN would be unrealistic for the formation of an organization espousing democracy as a fundamental human right, but the combination of UN ideals with the military concentration of NATO and the economic and political integration of the EU into a super-state would have the leverage to act as the arbiter of humanity across the world. While this vision may be utopian, and far from reaching the challenges that humanity faces in the next century are so overwhelming that the only way to overcome them is a new era of international cooperation. A new generation of leaders is sweeping across the world, with the power to bind us together past the petty differences and arbitrary boundaries that have divided us for too long. The time to act for a better future, for a future at all, is now.
