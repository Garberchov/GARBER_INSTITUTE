Did European powers take notice, and change their actions in response to the Monroe Doctrine?

Revised to:
How did the Monroe Doctrine ensure America's position in the Western Hemisphere. 

With this discussion - please identify the key intent of the Monroe Doctrine and (simplified) "why" for its necessity.  Was it AIMED at European powers, which ones, and of the leaders discussed - be sure to give them some PERSONIFICATION/global leadership characteristics (so we aren't reading about one-dimensional actors -- ie. not "just" that they were leading a country but that they were "a demonstrated power hungry dictator who systemically oppressed racial minorities through extermination programs and aggressively utilized the military to make land grabs on the borders of XX and XX".  (That was a random example of how to give the leader(s) some characterization. 
### Response

The Monroe Doctrine, prescribed by President James Monroe was an American sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere with the main purpose of excluding European colonial powers from dominating their newly freed colonies. While The Monroe Doctrine was at the time an act of hubris unparalleled in foreign policy circles due to the lack of a notable U.S. Navy, the fact that the U.S. was willing to make demands of European powers at all raised the standing of the nation on the world stage. More important than excluding European colonial powers from having any influence in the Western Hemisphere, something the U.S. had no practical means of accomplishing was the establishment of U.S. soft power in the form of economic and diplomatic strength in the Western Hemisphere.

The economic dominance over the Western Hemisphere that the Monroe Doctrine precipitated became more widespread as the major European Powers largely divested from their colonies in the New World and granted them independence. It was commonplace at the time for colonies to act simply as sources of natural resources that could be fed into the more industrialized mother economy due to the widespread policy of mercantilism. Without an industrial base to draw upon, the colonies would both be more subservient because of their need to import finished goods and easier to control as they wouldn't have the facilities for the large-scale manufacture of weapons. However, as South America became a less desired area for colonization both due to there being richer territories elsewhere and the geographical distance from European shores, the colonial powers began to focus their resources on the colonization of Asia and Africa. Then, as a direct result of America raising its stature diplomatically, its industrializing economy, and the encouragement of many former colonial nations to revolt, America naturally fell into a position of a favored trading partner that both sold finished goods and exported the machines needed to make them domestically. 

A good example of this was the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, first proposed 81 years after Monroe's proposal. Theodore Roosevelt's policy as President was to seek American aims through economic and diplomatic pressure first but not to be scared to use force if necessary. This is best shown in the efforts to ensure the construction of the Panama Canal, a vital waterway that in the modern era dramatically increases pan-ocean shipping and has bolstered the American economy and military. Roosevelt's Secretary of State John Hay negotiated the treaty for the construction of the canal with Columbia's foreign minister but was seen as unacceptable by their congress. Thus snubbed, Roosevelt began encouraging the Panamanian independence movement and even sent American warships to bolster their claim. The Panamanians immediately agreed to the construction of the canal and it was completed by 1914. By originally seeking to negotiate a treaty that would have been a boon to both economies and then seeking out a solution that suited American interests Roosevelt set an important precedent in the application of the doctrine as America rose through the ranks of world nations to become a major power.
