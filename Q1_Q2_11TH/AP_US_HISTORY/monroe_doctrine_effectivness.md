### Was the Monroe Doctrine Effective?

### Prompt
Was the Monroe Doctrine an effective way to ensure American Interest in the Western Hemisphere?
Did European powers take notice, and change their actions in response to the Monroe Doctrine?

With this discussion - please identify the key intent of the Monroe Doctrine and (simplified) "why" for its necessity.  Was it AIMED at European powers, which ones, and of the leaders discussed - be sure to give them some PERSONIFICATION/global leadership characteristics (so we aren't reading about one-dimensional actors -- ie. not "just" that they were leading a country but that they were "a demonstrated power hungry dictator who systemically oppressed racial minorities through extermination programs and aggressively utilized the military to make land grabs on the borders of XX and XX".  (That was a random example of how to give the leader(s) some characterization. 
### Response

The Monroe Doctrine, named after President James Monroe who first proposed an American sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere with the main purpose of excluding European colonial powers from dominating their newly freed colonies had successes and failures but nevertheless influenced American foreign policy to the modern day. While The Monroe Doctrine was at the time an act of hubris unparalleled in foreign policy circles due to the lack of a notable U.S. Navy, the fact that the U.S. was willing to make demands of European powers at all raised the standing of the nation on the world stage. More important than excluding European colonial powers from having any influence in the Western Hemisphere, something the U.S. had no practical means of doing and thus was failed at completely was the establishment of U.S. economic and diplomatic preeminence in the Western Hemisphere, a power base which would prove necessary for the rapidly globalizing world.
