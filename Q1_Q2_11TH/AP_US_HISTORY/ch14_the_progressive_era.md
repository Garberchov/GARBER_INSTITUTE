#### The Muckrakers of the Progressive Era
 - In keeping with the mood of the Progressive Era (from around 1900-1917), the pen was used to combat social ills and evils and made calls for reform. Sensational, jaw-dropping articles were written by journalists who set out to investigate and reveal wrong-doing and to prompt American society to fix social, economic and political problems. Popular magazines, such as McClure's and Cosmopolitan, competed for readers and fueled the push for the provocative material. The bottom line for publishers was: the more shocking, the better. (Which is in NO WAY mirrored today *cough cough CNN + Fox News + MSNBC*)
 - Muckrakers targeted many turn-of-the-century injustices brought on by the large increase of immigrants, the rapid growth of the cities, unregulated big business and the influence of political machines, as well as many other social problems.
 - Journalists described immigrant ghettoes and the poor living conditions of tenement housing. They revealed the high number of industrial accidents and advocated for tougher health and safety standards. Muckrakers condemned exploitation of child labor and white slave traffic in women. Corruption in business, including unfair trusts, insurance fraud and dangers of patent medicines, were exposed. Muckrakers also criticized abuses of power in politics and government.
 - Also appearing in McClure's, Ida Tarbell wrote an extensive, factual expose against John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust in 1904. Her work against the 'Mother of all Trusts' was turned into a two-volume book, The History of the Standard Oil Company, published in 1904. She was the most influential female muckraker and was widely respected within the publishing world.
 - Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle, published in 1906, to expose the problems of workers in the big canning factories in Chicago. What the public remembered most about his book, however, were the deplorable, unsanitary conditions in the meat packing industry. According to Sinclair, ''A man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them, they would die, and then rats, bread and meat would go into the hoppers together.'' As Sinclair later himself said, ''I aimed for the nation's heart and hit their stomach.''

#### Work and Home Improvements 
 - From around 1900-1917, Progressive reformers applied a systematic approach to problems facing Americans in the workplace and at home. One approach arose from pragmatism, a philosophy popular in the early twentieth century. Followers of pragmatism, pragmatists, as they became known, stressed that the value of an idea was based on its usefulness as determined through practice and experimentation. William James, author of Pragmatism (1907), stressed that truth comes from the ability to solve problems. Many Progressive reformers adhered to pragmatist ideas, believing social problems could be fixed through intelligent and purposeful action.
 - The efficiency movement focused on eliminating waste and developing best practices. A prominent leader of the efficiency movement was Frederick W. Taylor, author of Principles of Scientific Management (1911). Taylor was an industrial engineer, who applied scientific management principles to plant organization and efficiency standards in work environments. The results were greater worker productivity and lower production costs. A key example of the efficiency movement is the large scale use of the assembly line by Henry Ford of the automobile industry. (Which was pioneered by my hero, William S. Knudsen)
 - When the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire (1911) broke out in New York City, 146 women died because emergency exits had been locked, and the women had become trapped. Some jumped to their death while others died in the fire. Across the country, at the local and state levels, factory inspection laws were implemented, protecting workers from fire hazards and dangerous working conditions. Health and safety standards improved sanitation, lighting, and workplace safety.
 - Labor unions grew considerably during the early twentieth century, particularly the American Federation of Labor. The Women's Trade Union League, formed in 1903, paired middle class female reformers with immigrant laborers to improve factory and working conditions. The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union grew stronger after the Triangle Shirtwaist incident.
 - Middle class women helped immigrant families adjust to American culture. By 1910, 400 settlement houses were in operation, and many were modeled after the work of Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago. Immigrants were instructed in English on how to properly care for their families, and their children were given safe places to play. Another influential reformer, Margaret Sanger, started her career as a public health nurse and opened the first birth control clinic in Brooklyn, New York in 1916. Her work was based on the large number of immigrant women who approached her to learn how to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
 - Consumer protection laws, such as the Pure Food and Drug Act (1906) and Meat Inspection Act (1906), helped assure the quality and safety of food and drugs. A treaty aimed at stopping the opium trade was signed in 1912, and the Narcotics Act (1914) regulated addictive drugs. Other public health initiatives included vaccination programs, medical examinations at schools, and educating the public on good hygiene and communicable diseases.

#### Presidential Election of 1912
 - Theodore Roosevelt, former president of the United States, actually won most of the Republican primaries, even in President William Howard Taft's home state of Ohio. Despite Roosevelt's popular support, he was not able to overcome the power of Taft's supporters within the Republican Party. A group of Republicans refusing to support Taft's nomination at the Republican National Convention formed the Progressive Party and named Theodore Roosevelt as their candidate for president.
 - Taft has a solid antitrust record, using ninety lawsuits against the trusts during his time as president. Taft supports high import tariffs, limitations on child and female labor and workmen's compensation laws. He is against initiative, referendum and recall. Taft has promoted the idea that judges need to be more powerful than those elected to office. Taft is determined to preserve the conservative heart of the Republican Party. He has campaigned quietly. Some say it's because he knows he has a slim chance of winning now that traditional Republican support has been split between the conservative Republican Party and the Progressive Party.
 - Challenging Taft for the presidency is Democrat Woodrow Wilson, hailing from South Carolina. Wilson was president of Princeton University and later developed a strong reform record as the governor of New Jersey. His platform consists of his 'New Freedom.' Wilson wants to implement antitrust legislation to eliminate monopolies, viewing big business as unfair and inefficient. Wilson feels that big business reduces opportunity for many ordinary Americans. He seeks an era of small government, small businesses and free competition. Wilson is also critical of organized labor, socialism and radical farmers. Wilson supports Progressive legislation, including tariff reduction, income tax reform, currency and credit reform.
 - Also throwing his hat into the ring is the Socialist Eugene V. Debs. Debs was a labor organizer and one of the most prominent socialists in the United States. Some members of the Socialist Party propose ending America's capitalist economic system and replacing it with a socialized economic system.
 - And last, but not least, the former President and Progressive 'Bull Moose' candidate, Theodore 'Teddy' Roosevelt. Roosevelt's platform formed around his New Nationalism principles, which include a broad range of social and political reforms, including a federal child labor law, federal workmen's compensation, regulation of labor relations and a minimum wage for women. The Progressive Party also advocates lower tariffs, initiative, referendum, recall, direct election of senators and direct primaries.
 - Wilson and the Democrats have won with 435 electoral votes, Roosevelt and the Progressive 'Bull Moose' Party came in second with 88 electoral votes, while Taft and the Republican Party came in third with 8 electoral votes. Debs did not score any electoral votes, but he did manage to earn 6% of the popular vote, the highest proportion ever for the Socialist party. It is also quite clear that the split in the Republican Party has contributed to the Democrats' victory.

#### The Great Migration
 - As millions of young men went to Europe to fight, and as the American economy transitioned from peacetime to wartime production, factories and industries boomed and needed workers. Women laborers filled some of these vacancies, but African Americans moved into these jobs in extraordinary numbers. Northern factory managers sent labor recruiters to the South to bring black Southerners into the war industries of northern cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati.
 - This movement from the South to the North is called the Great Migration. African American workers eagerly left their low-paying jobs as agricultural laborers and domestic servants in the rural South and headed north in massive numbers. In the major cities of the Midwest and Northeast, they found relatively high paying jobs in meatpacking plants, shipyards, and steel mills.
 - The second significant cause of the Great Migration was the desire of black Southerners to escape segregation, known euphemistically as Jim Crow. Rural African American Southerners believed that segregation - and racism and prejudice against blacks - was significantly less intense in the North.
 - Between 1914 and 1920 almost half a million African American Southerners left plantations and farms and Jim Crow and headed north, where they sought higher paying jobs in the war industries and attempted to escape virulent racism. From 1910 to 1920, for instance, the black population of New York increased over 66% to more than 150,000, and the number of Cleveland's African American residents jumped 307% to around 35,000. Extraordinarily, during that same period Detroit experienced a 611% rise in the black population, to over 40,000.
 0 The significant increase in the African American population of the North was a major effect of the Great Migration. But once black Southerners arrived, they found reality didn't often parallel their optimistic expectations. Women were more likely than men to find quick steady work as domestic servants, cooks, or laundresses. Rather than immediately finding a high-paying skilled job in the war industries and manufacturing sector, African American men often had to accept lower wages as construction workers, teamsters, porters, or custodians.
 - The optimism of African American migrants was also shattered by a series of violent race riots stemming from the movement of people during the Great Migration. In St. Louis, employers had recruited black laborers to break the power of unions. Local unions refused to admit African American members, and this tension broke open in the summer of 1917 when white mobs in East St. Louis attacked newly arrived black laborers, killing at least 200. In Chicago, too, riots left 23 blacks and 15 whites dead in 1919. Tulsa, Oklahoma, experienced the worst violence, when in 1921 the entire black neighborhood of Greenwood was burned to the ground after racial animosity spilled into the streets.

#### Women's Suffrage
 - Many historians point to the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, as the start of the women's suffrage movement. Early feminist leaders brought attention to women's rights by calling for improved legal status, economic opportunity and the right to vote. Another early women's rights leader who challenged existing social norms and inequalities between the sexes was Susan B. Anthony. Anthony and Stanton first proposed a national women's suffrage amendment granting women the right to vote in 1878. Lucy Stone worked at the state level using a state-by-state approach to achieve voting rights for women. But it was not until 1920 when the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and National Woman's Party (NWP) finally secured the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting women the right to vote.
 - During the Progressive Era, women's clubs helped expand middle-class women's roles outside of the home. Initially concentrated on education and literacy, women's clubs began working to alleviate social problems. Women were key players in the push for prohibition (meaning outlawing the sale and consumption of alcohol), improved housing standards, regulations of the food and drug industry and government inspections of factories. The settlement house movement provided assistance to immigrant communities and led to the rise of social work. Women's organizations supported laws regarding women and children, such as public assistance for mothers with dependent children and a minimum wage law for women and children. Some middle class women joined laborers to push for laws protecting workers. Women joined labor unions, held meetings, picketed and raised money to support their causes.
 - By the turn of the century, only four western states allowed women full suffrage. So why exactly did women's suffrage take so long to achieve? As with many controversial political issues, there was substantial opposition. Anti-suffrage organizations, newspapers and petitions were formed to stop women's suffrage gains. Some upper-class women opposed the women's suffrage movement, arguing that women were encroaching on men's territory. The anti-suffrage movement contended that granting women the right to vote was challenging the 'natural order' of society, and they attempted to associate women's suffrage with compromised morals, even leading to neglect of children and divorce. The most significant resistance to women's suffrage came from the South and East.
 - In 1900, Susan B. Anthony retired from the leadership of NAWSA and Carrie Chapman Catt became the organization's new president. A skilled political organizer, Catt called for organization at the local levels, while retaining firm national control. NAWSA worked steadily to gain women suffrage state by state, and slowly but surely, additional states joined the women's suffrage ranks.
 -  Paul and Lucy Burns had spent time in Britain observing the women's suffrage movement and brought back to the States some of the militant tactics used over there. Upon their return, the women served on NAWSA's Congressional Committee, whose main purpose was to lobby Congress for a national suffrage amendment. Paul and Burns went on to form the National Woman's Party (NWP). The NWP was more confrontational than NAWSA. Some of these tactics used by Paul and her followers included aggressive lobbying of government officials, civil disobedience, picketing the White House during wartime, demonstrations and even hunger strikes. Many members of the NWP were arrested and imprisoned. Some were even force fed to end hunger strikes. While not all of these tactics may seem extreme today, these activities were shocking and brought increased attention to the women's suffrage movement.
 - President Woodrow Wilson had dodged supporting a federal women's suffrage amendment for several years. He endorsed women's suffrage initiatives at the state level in the 1916 Presidential Democratic platform. In that same year, Jeannette Rankin from Montana was the first woman to be elected to Congress. It was not until 1918 that President Wilson finally supported the 19th Amendment, partly due to women's contributions during World War I.
 - Decades after the women's suffrage amendment was first proposed, the U.S. Senate adopted the 19th Amendment by a close vote on June 4, 1919. It took 14 months for the states to ratify the amendment (meaning to approve by vote), which happened on August 18, 1920. The 19th Amendment states: 'The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.' The 19th Amendment granting nationwide women's suffrage was nicknamed the Susan B. Anthony amendment in her honor.
