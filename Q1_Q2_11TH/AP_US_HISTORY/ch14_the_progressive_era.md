#### The Muckrakers of the Progressive Era
 - In keeping with the mood of the Progressive Era (from around 1900-1917), the pen was used to combat social ills and evils and made calls for reform. Sensational, jaw-dropping articles were written by journalists who set out to investigate and reveal wrong-doing and to prompt American society to fix social, economic and political problems. Popular magazines, such as McClure's and Cosmopolitan, competed for readers and fueled the push for the provocative material. The bottom line for publishers was: the more shocking, the better. (Which is in NO WAY mirrored today *cough cough CNN + Fox News + MSNBC*)
 - Muckrakers targeted many turn-of-the-century injustices brought on by the large increase of immigrants, the rapid growth of the cities, unregulated big business and the influence of political machines, as well as many other social problems.
 - Journalists described immigrant ghettoes and the poor living conditions of tenement housing. They revealed the high number of industrial accidents and advocated for tougher health and safety standards. Muckrakers condemned exploitation of child labor and white slave traffic in women. Corruption in business, including unfair trusts, insurance fraud and dangers of patent medicines, were exposed. Muckrakers also criticized abuses of power in politics and government.
 - Also appearing in McClure's, Ida Tarbell wrote an extensive, factual expose against John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust in 1904. Her work against the 'Mother of all Trusts' was turned into a two-volume book, The History of the Standard Oil Company, published in 1904. She was the most influential female muckraker and was widely respected within the publishing world.
 - Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle, published in 1906, to expose the problems of workers in the big canning factories in Chicago. What the public remembered most about his book, however, were the deplorable, unsanitary conditions in the meat packing industry. According to Sinclair, ''A man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them, they would die, and then rats, bread and meat would go into the hoppers together.'' As Sinclair later himself said, ''I aimed for the nation's heart and hit their stomach.''

#### Work and Home Improvements 
 - From around 1900-1917, Progressive reformers applied a systematic approach to problems facing Americans in the workplace and at home. One approach arose from pragmatism, a philosophy popular in the early twentieth century. Followers of pragmatism, pragmatists, as they became known, stressed that the value of an idea was based on its usefulness as determined through practice and experimentation. William James, author of Pragmatism (1907), stressed that truth comes from the ability to solve problems. Many Progressive reformers adhered to pragmatist ideas, believing social problems could be fixed through intelligent and purposeful action.
 - The efficiency movement focused on eliminating waste and developing best practices. A prominent leader of the efficiency movement was Frederick W. Taylor, author of Principles of Scientific Management (1911). Taylor was an industrial engineer, who applied scientific management principles to plant organization and efficiency standards in work environments. The results were greater worker productivity and lower production costs. A key example of the efficiency movement is the large scale use of the assembly line by Henry Ford of the automobile industry. (Which was pioneered by my hero, William S. Knudsen)
 - When the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire (1911) broke out in New York City, 146 women died because emergency exits had been locked, and the women had become trapped. Some jumped to their death while others died in the fire. Across the country, at the local and state levels, factory inspection laws were implemented, protecting workers from fire hazards and dangerous working conditions. Health and safety standards improved sanitation, lighting, and workplace safety.
 - Labor unions grew considerably during the early twentieth century, particularly the American Federation of Labor. The Women's Trade Union League, formed in 1903, paired middle class female reformers with immigrant laborers to improve factory and working conditions. The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union grew stronger after the Triangle Shirtwaist incident.
 - Middle class women helped immigrant families adjust to American culture. By 1910, 400 settlement houses were in operation, and many were modeled after the work of Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago. Immigrants were instructed in English on how to properly care for their families, and their children were given safe places to play. Another influential reformer, Margaret Sanger, started her career as a public health nurse and opened the first birth control clinic in Brooklyn, New York in 1916. Her work was based on the large number of immigrant women who approached her to learn how to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
 - Consumer protection laws, such as the Pure Food and Drug Act (1906) and Meat Inspection Act (1906), helped assure the quality and safety of food and drugs. A treaty aimed at stopping the opium trade was signed in 1912, and the Narcotics Act (1914) regulated addictive drugs. Other public health initiatives included vaccination programs, medical examinations at schools, and educating the public on good hygiene and communicable diseases.

#### Presidential Election of 1912
 - Theodore Roosevelt, former president of the United States, actually won most of the Republican primaries, even in President William Howard Taft's home state of Ohio. Despite Roosevelt's popular support, he was not able to overcome the power of Taft's supporters within the Republican Party. A group of Republicans refusing to support Taft's nomination at the Republican National Convention formed the Progressive Party and named Theodore Roosevelt as their candidate for president.
 - Taft has a solid antitrust record, using ninety lawsuits against the trusts during his time as president. Taft supports high import tariffs, limitations on child and female labor and workmen's compensation laws. He is against initiative, referendum and recall. Taft has promoted the idea that judges need to be more powerful than those elected to office. Taft is determined to preserve the conservative heart of the Republican Party. He has campaigned quietly. Some say it's because he knows he has a slim chance of winning now that traditional Republican support has been split between the conservative Republican Party and the Progressive Party.
 - Challenging Taft for the presidency is Democrat Woodrow Wilson, hailing from South Carolina. Wilson was president of Princeton University and later developed a strong reform record as the governor of New Jersey. His platform consists of his 'New Freedom.' Wilson wants to implement antitrust legislation to eliminate monopolies, viewing big business as unfair and inefficient. Wilson feels that big business reduces opportunity for many ordinary Americans. He seeks an era of small government, small businesses and free competition. Wilson is also critical of organized labor, socialism and radical farmers. Wilson supports Progressive legislation, including tariff reduction, income tax reform, currency and credit reform.
 - Also throwing his hat into the ring is the Socialist Eugene V. Debs. Debs was a labor organizer and one of the most prominent socialists in the United States. Some members of the Socialist Party propose ending America's capitalist economic system and replacing it with a socialized economic system.
 - And last, but not least, the former President and Progressive 'Bull Moose' candidate, Theodore 'Teddy' Roosevelt. Roosevelt's platform formed around his New Nationalism principles, which include a broad range of social and political reforms, including a federal child labor law, federal workmen's compensation, regulation of labor relations and a minimum wage for women. The Progressive Party also advocates lower tariffs, initiative, referendum, recall, direct election of senators and direct primaries.
 - Wilson and the Democrats have won with 435 electoral votes, Roosevelt and the Progressive 'Bull Moose' Party came in second with 88 electoral votes, while Taft and the Republican Party came in third with 8 electoral votes. Debs did not score any electoral votes, but he did manage to earn 6% of the popular vote, the highest proportion ever for the Socialist party. It is also quite clear that the split in the Republican Party has contributed to the Democrats' victory.
