#### President Jefferson
 - The election of 1800 was a circus that put the future of the young nation in peril, the electors cast ballots for the President and whomever came in second place automatically became his vice-president. This created an obvious conflict between them, and this was only exacerbated by the fact that the new Democrat-Republican party wanted Aaron Burr to be VP, so they split their votes. However, it ended up being a tie between Jefferson and Burr and it was sent to the House of Representatives. The House had a Federalist majority however, and they were prepared to make Aaron Burr President instead of Jefferson just to stop him policies but Alexander Hamilton's personal hatred of Burr made him swing the party that he led to the candidate he disliked least: Jefferson. When Hamilton again tried to destroy Burr's political career as governor of New York, Burr challenged him to a duel and killed him.
 - Jeffersonian Democracy was highly focused on the idea of the independent family farm, personally believing them to be the most fundamental and honorable form of humanity.
 - Of course, Jeffersonian Democracy - like all political movements - had its share of failures, empty promises, and hypocrisy. Of course, the Democratic-Republican presidents had their critics, perhaps most famously in the Supreme Court. And it might be one of history's worst-kept secrets that Jefferson didn't exactly live by the ideals he claimed to treasure. But Thomas Jefferson, for all his flaws, was one of America's most intelligent, inquisitive, and innovative Founding Fathers. And though he didn't know exactly how to apply it in his time, he eloquently expressed what has become perhaps America's most cherished value: that all men are created equal.
 - Thomas Jefferson took office in 1801. During the campaign, his party had created visions of an agrarian paradise protected by a small government with no standing military and no debt. And he was a strict constructionist. Meaning, if it isn't in the Constitution, he believed the government doesn't have a right to do it. But many of Jefferson's most important domestic achievements seemed to be in stark contrast to his platform.
 - Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in the new permanent capital, Washington, D.C., and live in the completed White House - though you may not recognize either building today. When he moved into the president's country mansion, he complained that it was 'big enough for two emperors, one pope and the Grand Lama in the bargain.' Jefferson claimed that he opposed grandeur and elitism, yet he immediately began designing additions to the White House (including the photogenic West Wing colonnade).
 - Around the time of Jefferson's election, Napoleon Bonaparte was in secret negotiations with Spain to reclaim North American territory that France had lost after the French and Indian War. They reached an agreement, but soon after, events unfolded which left France nearly bankrupt in the middle of another war. Napoleon realized that he couldn't afford to defend the Louisiana Territory. So, when the United States approached him about buying New Orleans in order to control access to the Mississippi River, Napoleon offered to sell them all of his land on the continent for 15 million. While that may seem cheap (it works out to about $.04 an acre), and the land proved to be very valuable to America, the Constitution didn't give Jefferson power to make such a purchase. What's worse, he didn't consult with Congress over the deal, exactly the kind of expansion of presidential power that Jefferson said he opposed.
 - Outrage over the Louisiana Purchase nearly split the country apart. Of course, some people approved, especially many Southerners. It doubled the size of the U.S. overnight, opening up huge amounts of inexpensive farmland. It guaranteed access to the Mississippi River. But many others vigorously opposed the purchase. Federalists thought it would lead to war with Spain. Congress, with its Democratic-Republican majority, opposed expanding the national debt, rather than eliminating it as Jefferson had promised. Members of both parties believed the purchase was unconstitutional. Some Northerners foresaw this as an expansion of slavery. Jefferson's opponents in the Northeast recognized that this would further reduce their political clout. 
 - No political controversy today compares to the division in the country in 1803. The president's political enemies were ready to take action. The Essex Junto was a group of wealthy, powerful Federalists up in New England who thought Jefferson had overreached the power of the presidency with the Louisiana Purchase. They hatched a plot to secede from the United States. The key to their success would depend on getting New York to agree.
 - Thankfully, one of President Jefferson's staunchest political opponents - Alexander Hamilton - foiled the plot. The conspiracy had approached Vice President Aaron Burr and promised to help him win the governorship of New York if he'd make sure the state immediately seceded from the Union. Burr actually agreed, but his old nemesis, Hamilton, worked to secure his loss in that gubernatorial election. Without Burr and New York, the secession movement died. Burr was so angry he challenged Hamilton to a duel and killed him. Though murder charges against him were actually dropped, Burr's political career in the U.S. was, of course, over.
 - In the same year that Burr was arrested (1806), Thomas Jefferson accomplished what may be his most enduring legacy as president: the successful completion of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Even before the purchase was made, Jefferson had created the Corps of Discovery to send explorers through the new land (and beyond) to the Pacific Ocean. The president hired his secretary, Meriwether Lewis, and Lewis' friend, William Clark, to lead the expedition. The 33 members of the so-called 'permanent party' departed from St. Louis on May 14, 1804. Along the way, they were joined by various people, including a French trapper and his Shoshone wife, Sacajawea, who served as cooks, translators and diplomats. Their infant son, nicknamed Pomp, helped indicate the Corps' peaceful intentions to the people they encountered.
 - One of President Jefferson's last great acts was signing a bill that outlawed the Atlantic slave trade, effective January 1, 1808. The Constitution itself had set that as the earliest date allowed for such a law, not wanting the issue of slavery to interfere with the development of the young nation. Although slavery itself was still legal - and growing - the act prohibiting importation of slaves made it a crime to bring new slaves into America from overseas. There was smuggling of course, but the law was enforced, having the effect of raising prices for slaves, and encouraging the practice of selling slave children for profit.



#### The first Barbary War
 -  15 years (between 1792 and 1807), American exports increased by 585%! Jefferson also took advantage of Napoleon's financial problems to purchase the Louisiana Territory.
 - But it wasn't long before American merchant ships were being harassed by pirates from the North African Barbary coast. For centuries, Barbary pirates had terrorized the Mediterranean Sea, seizing goods and ships, kidnapping sailors to be sold into slavery if a ransom wasn't paid. But before the Revolution, American ships had been protected by the British Navy and, for a short time afterward, by the French. Now, they were on their own. George Washington initiated negotiations with the pirates, and in 1797 President Adams agreed to pay an annual tribute to secure safe passage for American ships.
 - When Jefferson took office in 1801, the Pasha (sort of like a British lord) of Tripoli demanded $225,000. Although it was significantly less than previous administrations had paid in tribute, Jefferson refused. So, the Pasha declared war on the United States. Congress never officially declared war in return, but it did authorize Jefferson to protect American interests. Jefferson sent Navy ships and Marines to the shores of Tripoli in the First Barbary War. They defeated Tripoli at sea, defending the merchant vessels and securing a more advantageous treaty in 1805.
 - Is it Constitutional for the president to use the military if Congress hasn't declared war - even if Congress has given him or her the power to do so? Is it right to use the military to defend a nation's financial interests? Should the nation use federal resources to bail out civilians who have knowingly put themselves in harm's way for the sake of financial gain?
 - Jefferson and Congress (and most of the population) decided that defending America's right to international commerce was a federal concern because there was more at stake than just the fortunes of the ships' owners and the lives of the crew. They argued that if they didn't stand up to the bully when they had the chance, things would only get worse. The First Barbary War set the precedent that military force could be used, even without a formal declaration of war. Once again, Jefferson had expanded the scope of the presidency.
 - Despite the successful engagement with the Barbary pirates (or maybe because of it), both England and France tried to provoke the United States into taking a side in the Napoleonic Wars. They began harassing American ships, stealing cargo, and the British often took the further step of pressing American sailors into service in the Royal Navy. Jefferson was still determined to stay neutral, but in 1807, the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair nearly drove America to war. The British Navy had been blockading some French ships in the Chesapeake Bay. According to the British, some of their own crew had deserted and taken sanctuary on American ships. The British warship Leopard attacked the American Navy ship Chesapeake and carried off four men. All of them had, in fact, served on British ships, but only one of them was an Englishman. The other three were Americans who had been pressed into service.
 - Instead, he tried to wage an economic battle against Britain and France. First, Congress implemented a boycott of British goods and then passed the Embargo Act of 1807, prohibiting American ships from sailing for foreign harbors. The goal was to create enough financial hardship for warring nations that they would accept U.S. neutrality and leave Americans ships - and sailors - alone. The move was a military, diplomatic and economic failure (although the three Americans were returned; the Englishman was hanged). Europeans continued to get the goods they wanted through smugglers that passed through Canada and continued to attack American ships. The only nation that was truly hurt by the trade restrictions was the U.S. when exports dropped by 80% in one year. An economic depression hit until the embargo was eased in 1809.
 
#### James Madison
 - When Thomas Jefferson announced his retirement, his secretary of state and the 'Father of the Constitution,' James Madison, was easily elected the fourth president of the United States, continuing the Virginia dynasty. He inherited a mess. The economy was struggling, he essentially had a war on two fronts and the political system was in shambles.
 - A Shawnee leader named Tecumseh and his brother (who was commonly called 'The Prophet') organized a social network to revive native religion, resist all white ways and oppose the U.S. government. They believed they would gain a northwest state for themselves. After building Prophetstown at the junction of the Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers, they began attacking settlements. The governor of the newly created Indiana Territory was General (and future president) William Henry Harrison. After learning that the British were supplying money and weapons to Tecumseh, Harrison attacked and destroyed Prophetstown at the Battle of Tippecanoe. However, the resistance and attacks on settlements continued on as part of the broader War of 1812 until Tecumseh himself was killed.
 - The War of 1812 is kind of a black hole in American history. Most people know that it happened, but not many people seem to know anything about it. So let's start with some big things: Two future presidents were heroes of the War of 1812. The White House was burned down. America's national anthem, the 'Star-Spangled Banner', was written during one of its battles. And, it's why the Native Americans ended up west of the Mississippi River. Events that are essential for a fuller understanding of American history.
 - Britain seemed determined to drag its former colonies into war. Congress lifted the Embargo Act of 1807, but then Britain interfered to keep America from trading with France. More importantly, the British navy had a desertion problem. Many sailors who had been pressed into service jumped ship as soon as they had the chance, so for years the British fleet had been stopping American ships to search for their deserters, sometimes pressing American citizens into service to boot.The trade restrictions and impressment controversy were frustrating, but each of them alone wasn't really enough for President Madison to want to declare war on Britain. But then you add in the fact that Britain had been helping the Indians fight on the  frontier, and together all of these factors were just a little too much for some people. The so-called 'War Hawks' in Congress convinced President Madison to declare war in June 1812.
 - President Madison hadn't really been prepared for a prolonged war. He was under the delusion that with Britain at war with France, the state militias could easily capture Canada, and a treaty would quickly follow. But Britain had its own army and navy, plus the coalition under Tecumseh and Canadian troops. The invasion of Canada was a total failure. But three battles in 1813 did help the U.S. get control of the western frontier. First, William Henry Harrison secured Detroit and finally defeated Tecumseh in the same fight. Then Commodore Oliver Perry captured an entire British naval squadron in the Battle of Lake Erie. Farther south, General (and another future president) Andrew Jackson defeated the Creek nation in 1814, subduing the Indian resistance. It wasn't a moment too soon for the Americans, since the war in the East was about to get a lot more difficult.
 - Britain's Royal Navy had finally run Napoleon out of town and put France in its place. Now they turned all of their attention to fighting America. The British navy waged fierce war at sea, and troops poured into the East Coast, fighting costly battles against weak American militia forces. They set fire to Washington, D.C., including the Capitol building and the White House. Thankfully, most of the city was saved by a freak rainstorm, and the president's wife, Dolly Madison, had the foresight to rescue some treasured items from their home, including George Washington's portrait and possibly an original copy of the Constitution.
 - Next, the British navy tried to capture the strategic city of Baltimore, blasting Ft. McHenry all day and most of the night. An American lawyer named Francis Scott Key had crossed enemy lines to negotiate a prisoner exchange and was being held on a British ship throughout the battle. He watched intently, but when the barrage stopped, it was too dark for him to see whose flag was flying over the fort. Had the British barrage stopped because the walls had been breached, or had they given up? He wouldn't be able to tell until dawn. When he saw an American flag in the morning, he was inspired to write a poem, which was later set to music, and the first verse became America's national anthem in 1916.
 - Three events began to unfold simultaneously. Leaders on both sides could see that neither side had much to gain by continuing the war, so diplomats in Ghent (called Belgium today) started talking peace. But few people in America knew about that. Federalists in New England, who had opposed the war from the beginning, met to discuss seceding from the Union. They planned to form a new nation and negotiate a favorable peace treaty with Britain on their own. Also, at the same time, a British fleet was heading toward New Orleans.
 - The first of these parties to conclude their business were the diplomats in Ghent. They reached an agreement on Christmas Eve 1814, and the Treaty of Ghent essentially returned everything to the way it had been before the war started. Britain abandoned their Indian allies once again but did pay the U.S. government for a number of slaves who had escaped to Canada. But news traveled slowly from Europe to America back then, and the British threw everything they had at New Orleans, intending to seize control of the Mississippi River. Andrew Jackson mounted a seemingly miraculous defense with a force made up of state militia, pirates, free blacks and a few regular army soldiers. He killed the British general in charge and won the Battle of New Orleans. 

#### The Era of Good Feelings
 - Despite enduring a total naval blockade and heavy losses, many Americans felt that the nation had won the War of 1812. General Andrew Jackson's ragtag force of free blacks, pirates and militia defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans after the Treaty of Ghent was signed, but Americans didn't know that at the time. It certainly appeared that Jackson's heroic victory, on the heels of Britain's failed invasion of Baltimore, had forced the British to surrender. Federalists who had intended to secede New England in protest over the war were thoroughly discredited and their party gone for good from federal politics.
 - Of course, things aren't always as good as they seem. The Democratic-Republicans might have been the only viable political party on a national level, but the nation was actually deeply divided over several issues, especially its finances. At first, President Madison wanted to keep going down the road Jefferson had taken, undoing some of Hamilton's economic policies. For example, the Democratic-Republicans had totally opposed the Bank of the United States. Madison allowed the Bank's 20-year charter to expire during his first term, and he refused to sign a bill that reauthorized it. The party had believed that a national bank was unconstitutional and that it threatened to concentrate financial power with the elite at the expense of yeoman farmers. But then came the War of 1812, and Madison realized just how difficult it was to finance a war without a national bank, so he finally signed a bill chartering the Second Bank of the United States, which helped stabilize the economy.
 - Madison announced his support for Speaker of the House Henry Clay's American System, which included a protective tariff and several internal improvements. The tariff was designed to encourage the purchase of domestic goods and was only approved for three years. The internal improvements were roads and canals that Madison said would 'bind more closely together the various parts of our extended confederacy.' We take for granted that the federal government pays for this kind of internal improvement, but many, many Americans back then thought this was a massive overreach of power, and internal improvements became one of the most divisive political issues of the 19th century, which is ironic in the modern day as infrastructure is one of the most bipartisan issues(despite the fact that the party not in power opposes it so they can eventually take credit for it).
