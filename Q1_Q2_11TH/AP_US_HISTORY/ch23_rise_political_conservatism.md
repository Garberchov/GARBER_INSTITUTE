### The Rise of Political Conservatism

#### Ronald Reagan
 -While the Democratic Party was battling over their candidate for the presidential election of 1980, the Republican Party rallied behind former California Governor Ronald Reagan. It was not an easy selection for the Republican Party as there were a number of notable candidates, such as future President George H.W. Bush, Senator Bob Dole and Illinois Representative John Anderson. Reagan, however, had an impressive track record in elections. In the presidential election of 1968, Reagan made impressive strides, but fell short to Richard Nixon who went on to become president. In 1976, Reagan narrowly lost the Republican primary to incumbent President Gerald Ford. In 1980, Reagan finally broke through and claimed the Republican nomination on the first ballot. He immediately chose George H.W. Bush as his running mate.
 - Ronald Reagan represented the rise of the New Right, or the return to right-wing conservative politics, in America. Nixon was supposed to be the conservative torchbearer in 1968 after Americans grew tired of the liberal politics of President Lyndon Johnson. Yet, he struggled significantly due to the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal. His successor, Gerald Ford, also failed to achieve success. Reagan seemed to be the most promising choice to lead the New Right in 1980. His campaign promises reflected the conservative sentiment that Americans were seeking following two decades of despair.
 - Reagan's campaign focused on the idea of a new America. He believed in a stronger national defense, including a major military buildup to continue to combat international communist aggression during the Cold War. Reagan rejected an expansive federal government in favor of laissez faire politics, which meant limited government intervention. Economically, Reagan campaigned on the notion of supply-side economics, and promised a balanced budget and lower tax rates on businesses and Americans.
 - Reagan promoted a return to traditional family values. He also supported religion, especially prayer in public schools. Reagan promised seminal changes for women's rights in the United States. In addition to guaranteeing the addition of women to his cabinet, as well as the Supreme Court, Reagan championed anti-discrimination legislation for women, as well as full equality throughout the nation. Similarly, Reagan touted a color-blind social policy that would assist all Americans regardless of color.
 - Reagan had gained the confidence of a wide array of Americans during his campaigning in 1980. Women, business owners, laborers, religious leaders and members of the conservative right all supported Reagan. Conversely, Carter stood little chance against the ruthless campaigning of his opponent. Reagan regularly asked, 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' He repeatedly referred to what was known as the 'misery index,' which was the mixture of the unemployment rate and inflation. Reagan also criticized Carter's foreign policy initiatives, often regarding them as embarrassing and overly cautious.
 - On November 4, 1980, it was the nation's turn to speak. American overwhelmingly sided with Reagan and the conservative New Right politics that he represented. The presidential election of 1980 witnessed Reagan, in a landslide, claim 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49.

#### Reagan's Foreign Policy
 - Reagan was unafraid to spend to defeat the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Reagan approved of the National Security Defense Directive-66 (NSDD-66) to appropriate funds aimed at undermining the Soviet economy. Reagan followed by issuing National Security Defense Directive-75 (NSDD-75), which modernized United States nuclear and military forces to demonstrate to the Soviet Union that the United States would not back down. Simultaneously, the Navy was enlarged and advanced missile systems were strategically placed throughout Europe.
 - The largest expenditure within Reagan's foreign policy was the Strategic Defense Initiative. This was known as the 'Star Wars' program as it called for a massive space-based shield to defend the United States from long-range Soviet missiles. The immediate upfront cost of the program (just to begin the research phase) was roughly $26 million. Congress approved some funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, but the program was never fully implemented as the Cold War began winding down toward the end of the decade.
 - In Lebanon, Reagan supported Israeli forces that were combating Lebanese Muslims who aligned with the Soviet Union and communist Syria. Irritated by the inability of the Israelis to defeat the Lebanese Muslims, Reagan, in 1982, deployed 1,400 marines to the region. Unfortunately, Reagan's first test of force was met with a severe loss. In 1983, suicide bombers from the Lebanese Muslim forces (officially known as the 'Islamic Jihad') exploded a device inside of a Marine compound, killing 241 soldiers. Reagan quickly withdrew, fearful of the American backlash.
 - Successful American military action in Grenada (a small island in the Caribbean) helped to reverse the negativity toward Reagan's foreign initiatives. At the onset of the engagement in 1983, Reagan deployed 2,000 American soldiers under Operation Urgent Fury to the island. The mission was to successfully remove the socialist government installed in Grenada (as it was associated with Cuban leader Fidel Castro) and replace it with a democratic institution. The engagement lasted a few short weeks and Reagan declared the invasion a triumph.
 - The Iran-Contra affair was a convoluted foreign policy disaster for Reagan. Beginning in 1984, Reagan decided to support a pro-America regime in Nicaragua known as the Contras. His hope was to provide enough aid so that the Contras were capable of removing the socialist, and largely anti-American, Sandinista regime (yes, the same regime President Richard Nixon helped to install). Reagan authorized the training of the Contras, while launching a campaign to discredit the Sandinista regime throughout the world. The problem was Reagan had to maintain the secrecy of his efforts to train and fund the Contras from Congress because a ban on American aid had been established. He found the money by selling weapons to Iran, which was a sworn enemy of the United States. The money from the sale of the weapons was then used to fund the Contras. The problem was that the United States was not supposed to be selling weapons to Iran. The Iran-Contra affair was a major scandal that led to the resignation of National Security Advisor, John Poindexter, and the conviction of several high-ranking officials.
 - After all of Reagan's rhetoric aimed at the Soviet Union and his call for a massive military buildup to renew the Cold War, diplomacy proved to be the most successful foreign policy tool. Neither nation could continue to burden its respective economy with military expenditures. Also helping the cause was the election of the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev proved to be more moderate in his political leanings and overall feelings toward the United States. He also understood that the Cold War economic battles with the United States had crippled the Soviet Union. To extend peaceful overtures toward the United States, Gorbachev ended the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, severely curtailed funding to communist nations, liberalized the Soviet economy, known as perestroika, and opened the Soviet society, known as glasnost.
#### H.W Bush Foreign Policy
 - When it comes down to it, President George H.W. Bush was a highly regarded international tactician. This ability stemmed from his early career as a diplomat, an ambassador to the United Nations and as the director of the CIA. Bush embodied President Theodore Roosevelt's straightforward notion of 'speak softly and carry a big stick.'
 - When Bush assumed office in 1989, he established a foreign policy that prioritized diplomacy over force. This conservative approach was utilized in relations with China and the Soviet Union and in places like Germany and Somalia. However, whenever diplomacy was unattainable, Bush fully supported the use of force to remedy international crises, deploying military force to Latin America and the Middle East.
 - Bush's use of diplomacy to solve international issues was a trademark of his presidency. In fact, Bush attempted to encourage diplomatic solutions in all instances of aggression before using force. His belief in cooperation and negotiation yielded admirable results. In 1989, Bush's first foreign complication arose in China when the Chinese military violently overtook pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. 
 - While the international community called for action to be taken against the Chinese, Bush rejected the use of force in favor of sanctions. Why? Simply because Bush didn't want to ruin the relations between the United States and China that had improved drastically since the end of the Second World War.
 - Bush ensured the removal of the Berlin Wall in Germany. He agreed to a bilateral reduction of nuclear arms with the Soviet Union, which included the approval of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) in 1991. Bush's diplomatic aims with the Soviet Union helped to reduce any remaining tension between the two nations. The Soviet Union eventually collapsed in 1991, and Bush began working with Russian president Boris Yeltsin.
 - The collapse of the Berlin Wall posed a new set of international issues for the Bush Administration. The foremost problem was establishing protocol for the unification of Germany. All parties involved, including the United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain, pursued different measures in unifying the German nation. Bush campaigned for the 'two-plus-four' agreement, which called for joint cooperation between the four nations as well as East and West Germany. After the agreement was adopted, Bush presented a unification compromise that called for Germany to be admitted into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and granted the Soviet Union four years to withdraw its forces from the nation.


#### H.W. Bush Domestic Policy
 - The foremost task of Bush's domestic agenda was finding a way to balance the American economy. By 1990-91, the federal debt had climbed to roughly three trillion dollars, the economy entered into a mild recession and the unemployment rate was rising. Bush's ability to address domestic issues was curtailed to the point where he encouraged Americans to volunteer to help alleviate societal ills. Ultimately, Bush could not continue working with limited federal funds and an economy that was teetering on the brink of a major recession.
 - Bush opened discussions with Congress on solving the economic crisis. It was an uphill battle for the president as he faced a House of Representatives and a Senate that were controlled by Democrats. Members of the Democratic Party wanted Bush to tax the top earners in the nation and extend welfare benefits to the unemployed and impoverished. The Republican minority in Congress demanded that no new taxes be introduced. Instead, Republicans wanted Bush to slash federal funding for unnecessary domestic programs.
 - The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 called for a sizable tax hike on Americans in addition to increased spending on assistance programs, such as unemployment. Republicans were dismayed and alienated by the government, but their discontent for the Bush Administration grew greater following the Savings and Loan collapse. In an effort to bail out the Savings and Loan industry, Bush called for a massive federal appropriations package to ease the crisis. This action alone cost American taxpayers millions of dollars.
 - Bush's popularity rebounded slightly with the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. Initiated and signed by Bush in 1992, the agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico eliminated tariffs on traded goods between the three nations. The hope was that the establishment of free trade would boost the American economy by creating new jobs and manufacturing. While Bush signed the agreement in 1992, Congressional negotiating on the agreement extended beyond his presidential term. He ultimately was an important part of drafting the very liberal trade agreements for the United States and its fellow hemispheric nations.
 - Bush also took on several civil rights issues. The first was his passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). This was a landmark piece of legislation because it provided legal relief and accommodation to disabled Americans - legislation a first of its kind. The legislation primarily prohibited discrimination against the disabled in the workplace, in public facilities and public transportation. Additionally, the law gave disabled Americans new legal rights and precedents that could be used in lawsuits.
 - The second important piece of domestic civil rights legislation was the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Fearing the political backlash of his veto on an earlier piece of civil rights legislation in 1990, Bush moved forward with the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and provided Americans with the right to take workplace discrimination claims to court. Americans could also pursue emotional distress damages due to discrimination under the new civil rights agreement.
