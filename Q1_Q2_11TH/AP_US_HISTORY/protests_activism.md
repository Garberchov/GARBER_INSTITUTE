#### Johnson's Great Society
 - Upon assuming the presidency in 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson was tasked with the monumental assignment of continuing the initiatives of not only President John F. Kennedy's New Frontier, but of the welfare state that was created under President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s.
 - Johnson was successful in implementing New Frontier goals, such as a major tax cut, the creation of VISTA (which was the domestic version of the Peace Corps) and ensuring the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which officially prohibited racial discrimination in the United States. Yet, that was only the beginning.
 - After securing a resounding victory in the 1964 presidential election over conservative rival Barry Goldwater, Johnson embarked on a mission to permanently end poverty and racial inequality within the United States. Johnson named his program of sweeping legislation (close to 400 pieces) to combat the national societal ills the Great Society. The legislation of the Great Society aimed at tackling poverty, racial injustice, urban decay, unemployment, national beautification and education reform, just to name a few.
 - Another powerful piece of anti-discrimination legislation sought under the Great Society was the Immigration Act of 1965. This Act prohibited discrimination against immigrants from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Improving life for Americans did not stop at anti-discrimination legislation. Johnson pursued sweeping legislation that focused on water quality, the environment, park renewal and beautification, highway safety and child safety among others.
 - The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was created in order to begin the revitalization process within the inner cities.
 - Johnson began with revamping the healthcare system. The Great Society created two programs that would be nationally funded and benefit two groups of individuals: Medicare, which supplied coverage for the elderly, and Medicaid, which provided healthcare for those with a low income. Johnson also increased the welfare program in the United States.
 - The expansion of welfare included the beginning of the Food Stamp Program and aid to those families who could claim dependents. Additionally, the Model Cities Program helped provide cleaner, safer and cheaper living conditions for low-income families.
 - Many conservative politicians believed that the Great Society had surpassed its legal right to federal power. The argument against the program rested on the notion that the federal government did not have the right to intervene in all aspects of American society. The federal government had become too involved, and the conservative fear was that this kind of intervention could not be sustained.
 - Second, the Great Society, with its 400-plus pieces of legislation, could not be continuously funded. While aspects of the program did receive funding, taxpayers became hesitant to continue funding a program that did not benefit them personally. Lastly, another major funding issue was due to the Vietnam War. The conflict had severely drained the appropriations reserved for the Great Society, which meant that many programs were left underfunded or unfunded completely

#### Civil Rights Movement
 - Simply put, the war exposed the plight of African American people in the United States as no better than the tactics used by that of Adolf Hitler. Think of a fishbowl: the United States was the figurative fish and the world was watching its every move. At that point, the United States realized it could not continue a practice of gross inequality and discrimination.
 - Now, you must remember that this was still the Jim Crow Era, which was a period where Black people were segregated from white people under the concept of ''separate, but equal.'' Therefore, many American leaders had to tread carefully to prevent causing social and political backlash from white Southerners. The Brooklyn Dodgers successfully introduced Jackie Robinson, the first Black player to play Major League Baseball in 1947. Faced with a difficult political battle, President Harry Truman successfully desegregated the armed services in 1948.
 - Yet the largest accomplishment, and maybe most significant in terms of jumpstarting the civil rights movement, was the Supreme Court decision in Sweatt v. Painter, 1950. The ruling nullified the notion of ''separate, but equal'' when the Court ordered the University of Texas to admit a Black law student into an all-white law school.
 - Nineteen fifty-five was another pivotal year for the civil rights movement for two reasons. First, Rosa Parks challenged segregation on public transportation in Montgomery, Alabama when she refused to vacate her seat to a white rider. Parks was eventually arrested for her defiance, which touched off a major bus boycott. Eventually, in June 1956, the Supreme Court ruled in Browder v. Gayle that bus segregation was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
 - Second, Martin Luther King Jr. gained national notoriety as a prominent voice and leader within the civil rights movement. This was largely attributed to his assistance in creating the Montgomery Improvement Association, which encouraged a massive bus boycott in Alabama following the Rosa Parks incident.
 - There are numerous additional events that were associated with the civil rights movement in the 1950s. Let's take a look at just a few. In 1956, two important organizations were created: the Inter-Civic Council in Tallahassee, Florida, and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights in Birmingham, Alabama. Speaking of important associations, the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) under the leadership of Martin Luther King in 1957 was a nationally important organization that focused on desegregation and registering the votes of Black people. The Crusade for Citizenship, launched in late 1957, was the SCLC's first major effort in enfranchising Black people.
 - Equality for African American people has always faced a form of severe opposition, but the 1950s (and 1960s) epitomized the effort of whites to enforce second-class citizenship on Black people. Throughout the 1950s, segregationists and white supremacists acted with reckless abandon throughout the South. White people forced African American citizens to flee to northern and western cities. Southern politicians in Congress passed the Southern Manifesto, which pledged support for states that resisted integration due to its questionable legality. Many states adopted anti-NAACP laws.
