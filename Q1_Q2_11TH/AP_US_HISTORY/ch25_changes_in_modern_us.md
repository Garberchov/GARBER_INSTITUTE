#### Technological Revolutions:
 - Though the digital revolution has been under way for roughly 30-50 years already, some of its ramifications are just being felt. The essence of the digital revolution is computers, such as the one on your desk, on your lap, or even in your pocket, which allow information to be stored digitally on microchips. The digital revolution has replaced many other forms of storage and filing systems; gone, for example, are the rolodexes from libraries, or the numerous filing cabinets, which used to populate every office or home. Instead, hundreds, if not thousands, of documents can now be stored on a microchip smaller than a grape.
 - More than just storing information, the digitizing of everything - from media, to phones, to television broadcasts - has changed our lives in unexpected ways and will likely continue to do so. For example, the creation of high-definition television digitized the signal in which most television stations broadcast. The resulting picture was far clearer and crisper than the previous, analog signals.
 - One of the reasons the digital revolution has progressed so far so fast is the new and evolving field of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology refers to the creation of artificial structures at the smallest sizes possible - at times even down to the atomic or molecular levels! Like the digital revolution, nanotechnology is beginning to touch every aspect of our lives. Indeed, the two trends are working in concert: advances in nanotechnology are allowing digital code to be written on smaller and smaller surfaces, causing computing power and storage space to grow exponentially in recent years.
 - Nanotechnology, however, extends into far more realms than just information technology. In the coming years, some have their hopes pinned on nanotechnology to help solve many of the world's issues. For example, recent advances in nanotechnology have allowed scientists to create solar fuel cells that are both smaller and five times more effective than current silicon-based cells. Additionally, entirely new and quickly progressing fields, like nanorobotics, hope to create microscopic machines, which can build consumer goods, be used in complicated surgeries, and even self-replicate themselves if given the correct materials!
 - The third technological revolution we'll discuss is the Internet. Again, like the digital revolution, the Internet is not solely a creation of the 21st century; in fact, the Internet was pioneered in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee - not, as you might have heard, by Al Gore. Even though the Internet was around before the 21st century, it was in the past decade and a half that the Internet has truly become a facet of everyday life. The Internet has changed our lives in unexpected ways, allowing us to have a world of information at our fingertips, allowing some people to work entirely from their own homes, and creating entirely new digital communities.
 - Two concurrent innovations - social media and the smartphone - have both made the Internet a permanent fixture in the world today. Whether it's through Facebook, Twitter, or some other social media platform, social media has made it possible for people to stay connected with friends that live in distant locations or better coordinate activities with those close by. Additionally, the smartphone, which is not just a phone but essentially a small computer, has made the Internet accessible to nearly anyone at any time. The growth of the smartphone industry and the rapidly expanding uses for the Internet has also spurred the growth of Internet infrastructure; for example, many restaurants and bars now boast of having free wireless Internet connections available for patrons' phones and laptops.

#### Social Media:
 - Social media refers to any Internet website, smartphone application, or other modern technology that allows people to connect with one another and build online communities. The breadth of this definition is vast, including groups of friends in the same city who create an online community or message board to coordinate activities better and groups of people who have never met face-to-face and are simply united due to common interests or common causes. Social media is incredibly flexible this way. In general, it allows its users to decide what the uses of its product should be. This is a huge part of why it has become so successful so quickly.
 - One of the first of these platforms - and certainly the first to gain widespread acclaim - was Facebook. Facebook was created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and several of his Harvard classmates.(Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskowitz et cetera) Originally designed as a tool to allow Harvard students to view pictures and eventually communicate with other Harvard classmates, the site expanded to other universities and was opened to the public in September 2006. It grew the fastest in these first years, having approximately 100,000 users by August 2008. By September 2012, Facebook's one billionth user had created an account. 
 - Social media, especially Twitter, is also revolutionizing journalism. News outlets, which used to only get information from a reporter on the ground, can now gather information from countless sources who update their social media accounts as events happen. For example, when protests and revolution broke out across the Arab world in 2010 and 2011 - the so-called 'Arab Spring' - the tumultuous events were documented on social media, and the world didn't have to wait for a reporter to write up a story the following day. The news was reported as it happened.
 - For all of social media's positive effects on the world, the platform also has its detractors. Twitter, for instance, has been criticized for forcing more nuanced conversation to be boiled down so as to meet the platform's 140-character limit. Facebook and social media in general is often in the news over its inability - and some would claim unwillingness - to protect users' private information, selling it to marketing firms. In other ways, psychologists and sociologists claim social media has a detrimental effect on the human psyche, as several studies have shown conclusively that using social media actually makes the user feel more inadequate or insecure about their own life.
