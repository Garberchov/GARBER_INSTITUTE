### The Great Depression

#### The Wall Street Crash
 - From the turn of the century through the late 1920s, the United States enjoyed a period of economic prosperity. From 1922 to 1929, the gross national product, or the value of goods produced during the fiscal year, grew at an annual rate of 5%; the gross domestic product measured in at over $200 billion, and wages (for some) skyrocketed by 15%. Additionally, unemployment during the period never surpassed 5%.
 - However, on 'Black Tuesday' (October 29, 1929), the Wall Street stock market crashed and entrenched the United States in the Great Depression, the nation's lengthiest economic downturn, from 1929 to 1941. Within a few short months after the initial crash, stock prices collapsed by 50%. They would eventually fall an additional 30% at the peak of the Depression. Industrial output significantly contracted. Over 10,000 American banks, unable to sustain business, closed and left thousands of Americans without money. Between one-third to one-half of all American financial institutions collapsed. Those who had invested in the market frequently lost everything. To make matters worse, unemployment surged to 25% during the Depression years. Americans did what they could to survive, such as waiting in line at soup kitchens, scouring garbage cans and even theft. How could such a prosperous nation fall into economic despair? Let's take a look at the factors that contributed to the Great Depression.
 - The market also was not regulated as it is today. Unscrupulous agents frequently sold securities to investors which were essentially worthless. Some states had limited regulations known as Blue Sky Laws, which at least required providing a prospectus about the investment opportunity being offered. However, there was no nationwide framework to prevent these types of misdeeds. Combined with the problems caused by banks engaging in market speculation, it's no surprise the above led to the creation of the Securities & Exchange Commission shortly after the start of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency. The 1920s are the reason it was given a mandate to regulate the securities market.
 - Although the stock market crash has received the brunt of the blame for the Great Depression, unhinged market speculation by both banks and the general public were the core cause, especially for the severity. Farm incomes and wages were flat or declining in the 1920s. This created an environment where the average American could make more money from speculating on the stock market. Unlike today, banks were also playing the market. In the 1920s, banks increasingly used their customers' deposit to engage in market speculation themselves. This was a major factor in banks being unable to payout the value of the funds owed to their depositors. Banks did not keep sufficient reserves and many hadn't joined the Federal Reserve system. Even those banks in the Federal Reserve system only received warning letters in response to their high risk behavior. This also meant the banking system in America lacked a way to mount a coordinated response once the collapse started. In contrast, nations with more consolidated banking systems at that time, such as Canada, France, and the Netherlands experienced a milder, shorter depression.
 - As factory inventories built up, farm incomes failed to materialize, and corporate profits dwindled, the stock market plunged. Simultaneously, creditors who had supplied loans to investors began demanding the repayment of the loans after witnessing market earnings begin to spiral downward. Many of these creditors were the large number of banks who had wagered the funds of their depositors on the stock market. The financial system of the United States crumbled. When the Federal Reserve finally took meaningful action by raising interest rates from 5% to 6%, it was too late. The effect from this measure was that banks stopped lending, which dried up access to capital for businesses and it killed consumer spending. Both of which will make depressions worse.
 - While all of the aforementioned financial problems contributed to the collapse of the economic market, the failure of leadership by American presidents during the 1920s may have been the foremost catalyst to the Great Depression. During the period, the White House was occupied by the New Era Republicans - President Warren Harding, President Calvin Coolidge and President Herbert Hoover. These individuals projected pro-business politics and, in Harding's words, a 'return to normalcy.' These Republican presidents believed in supporting big business because it would provide prosperity for the nation.
 - While Harding's term was short and unimpressive, his successor, Coolidge, personified the ideas of the New Era Republicans. Coolidge repealed the progressive legislation of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and replaced it with a pro-business ideology that consisted of tax reduction for the wealthy, high wall tariffs, deregulation of business by the federal government and the placement of the economy into the hands of business leaders. As a result, the wealthiest Americans paid less in taxes and received more money; all other Americans received less in earnings and faced tax hikes. Simultaneously, the overproduction of goods led to a flooded market because average Americans could not afford to purchase products unless they pursued credit plans. Needless to say, Coolidge's pro-business political mentality only made the Great Depression more imminent.
 - Hoover added to the wanton disregard of the American economy and the American people. Continuing with the tradition of the New Era Republicans, Hoover called for cooperation between business and society over individualism. Unfortunately, businesses of the period marginalized the common American. Individuals, farmers and factory laborers, for instance, faced tax burdens, heightened prices, lower wages and a general devaluation of land and real estate, not to mention longer work days and more dangerous working conditions. These unchecked businesses also absorbed a significant amount of resources.


#### America During The Great Depression
 - When the Great Depression, the nation's worst economic downturn, began in October 1929, very few Americans understood the precarious nature of the situation. Between 1929 and 1932, the United States economy contracted severely. Production was cut in half and investments fell by $15 billion. By 1933, roughly half of the financial institutions in the United States were closed. Additionally, unemployment reached an unprecedented 25%, which translated to an estimated 13-15 million unemployed Americans.
 - The unemployment caused by the Great Depression was unprecedented to most working Americans. There had always been the opportunity to work for some type of wage or allotment. Yet, the number of unemployed skyrocketed from 3 million in 1930 to roughly 13-15 million by 1933. You must remember the unemployment compensation that we have today was unheard of during the Depression years. While President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, the legislative program aimed at ending the Great Depression, offered some unemployment benefits, most Americans were left to struggle to survive.
 - Many of the jobless resorted to desperate business practices. Within the larger cities, men would generally wait in lines for hours at job sites hoping to be chosen to earn a single day's wage to help support their families. Other family members attempted to sell household items and various fruits, such as apples, on street corners to compensate for the lack of income. Unfortunately, most unemployed Americans were unable to find a sustainable income during the Depression.
 - Many had their utilities canceled and, even worse, were evicted from their apartments and homes. Families were forced to wait in bread and soup lines for a token meal. Many even turned to leaders of organized crime for sustenance. Food riots occurred throughout the nation, which witnessed families breaking into grocery stores and stealing any food that was available. Owners began securing their food markets to the level of the banks!
 - Meanwhile, 'Hoovervilles' sprung up throughout the urban areas. These were makeshift cardboard and scrap metal homes that families were forced to inhabit due to foreclosure and eviction. The name was derived from the general contempt of President Herbert Hoover and his failure to end the suffering.
 - The American experience in the rural setting may have been worse than those living in the major United States cities. Farmers in the Midwest and central United States generally suffered for a number of reasons. Hoover's protective tariffs curbed farm production and lessened the profitability of selling farmed goods overseas. Farmers also faced an overabundance of production due to the creation of the tractor. Most of their products wasted away because consumer spending was drastically reduced with the onset of the Depression.
 - To make matters worse, overproduction of the land in the region, coupled with a massive drought, led to an ecological disaster for farmers. This disaster was known as the 'Dust Bowl,' which witnessed massive clouds of dust and debris travel for miles and buried homes, equipment and livestock. The dust even traveled as far as Boston and New York City!
 - The nation witnessed a number of labor upheavals as a result of economic conditions created by the Great Depression. In 1932, unemployed laborers from the Ford Motor Company launched a massive protest at the Ford plant in Dearborn, Michigan. The event turned violent as Ford unleashed a number of its guards, coupled with the Dearborn police, onto the disgruntled laborers. In 1934, Minneapolis Teamsters clashed with police over union-related issues.
 - While white Americans certainly suffered during the Depression years, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians faced worse economic conditions and heightened discrimination. Many minorities were the primary targets of termination by businesses in major cities. Minorities who were employed on farms were known as sharecroppers, or tenants who worked on a farmer's property and repaid the farmer in crops. Unfortunately, when the farmers were told to reduce their production, sharecropper's leases were immediately terminated due to the unavailable land. This generated a massive amount of unemployment in the black and Hispanic communities.
 - Hispanics and Asians were also targeted in the Pacific states. Many white Americans believed that these individuals had stolen jobs from the whites. A general disdain against Hispanics and Asians grew until the Hoover Administration approved the deportation of Hispanics from the United States. The forced migrations continued under the Roosevelt Administration until upward of two million Mexicans were removed from the United States.


#### President Herbert Hoover
 -  With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, President Herbert Hoover pursued various remedies aimed at reversing the course of the economic malady within the United States. While Hoover was partially responsible for contributing to the Depression, his attempts at curtailing the downturn were notable. Hoover's solution to the Great Depression included the policy of associationalism, an international resolution, and expanding the federal government. Unfortunately, it was not enough, as Hoover failed to end the largest economic collapse in United States history.
 - Hoover's first attempt to reversing the economic tide in the nation was through the issuance of his policy of associationalism. This idea encouraged all individuals within the United States to begin working together to solve their common economic issues in the hope that smaller collaboration could provide a larger and permanent remedy to the Depression. Farmers, laborers, financiers and businessmen were expected to work in unison to aid the nation's recovery; not to mention, Hoover hoped that this banding of various personalities would lead to a renewed sense of national pride.
 - Hoover owned a powerful reputation as an internationalist, especially after his major successes during the First World War. He thought a possible solution to the Depression was through the international community because he believed that the major aspects of the downturn were outside of American borders. Hoover first issued a temporary halt on loan payments owed by various European nations following the war. He also helped pass the Glass-Steagall Act of 1932, which expedited the ability of American banks to convert European investor's money into gold.
 - At first, Hoover was against the expansion of the federal government. Yet, since many of his other ideas at rejuvenating the American economy had failed, he decided to approve limited-expansion measures. For instance, he approved the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to provide loans to various institutions that were willing to construct low-cost public facilities. Hoover took additional measures in financing home construction as well.
 - Many took exception to Hoover's failed attempts at ending the Depression and his denigration of those Americans who were suffering. Many liberals rejected the Hoover Administration outright and began looking toward Russia for advice and assistance. Many adopted proletarian literature and joined the Communist Party in the hope of bettering their situation. Homeless Americans began building cardboard cities, aptly naming them 'Hoovervilles.' Poor Americans who could not afford gasoline tied horses to their cars and called them 'Hoover wagons.' Those who were homeless and unemployed often walked around with their pockets inside-out; this was known as a 'Hoover flag.'Others simply took to the streets. The Bonus Army, consisting of veterans from the First World War, ascended on Washington, D.C. in 1932 and demanded that the federal government pay a bonus of $1000 that was authorized to them in 1924. Membership in the Bonus Army swelled to upward of 20,000 veterans and many camped southeast of the Capitol and refused to move until they received payment. The House of Representatives approved the funding, but the Senate rejected the proposal.

#### FDR First New Deal
 - Upon assuming office in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced a desperate economy that was on the verge of total collapse. Yet, the eternal optimist Roosevelt reassured Americans that 'the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' Roosevelt brought a renewed sense of hope to America in his inaugural year, and a good majority of that positive sentiment stemmed from Roosevelt's New Deal program, which was an aggressive legislative campaign that expanded the federal government, provided assistance for Americans and attempted to end the Great Depression.
 -In his first 100 days in office, Roosevelt navigated 15 pieces of important legislation through Congress. While some of Roosevelt's New Deal legislation was successful in alleviating the suffering endured during the Depression, it is important to remember that the program did not end the Depression. Let's take a look at Roosevelt's first 100 days and the important New Deal legislation that he passed during this time.
 - Roosevelt's first several pieces of New Deal legislation focused primarily on preventing American banks from collapsing. He passed the Emergency Banking Act, which provided federal loans to save private banks, as well as the Economy Act, which called for a balanced budget. These two pieces of legislation suggest that Roosevelt distrusted the financial industry's ability to reorganize on its own.
 - In addition to preventing the financial sector from completely collapsing, Roosevelt had to ensure economic recovery. How? Good question. Roosevelt's theory in rebuilding the economy rested on the notion of limited production. He wanted farmers, laborers and businessmen to begin producing less in the hope that supply and demand would restore the market. Therefore, much of his legislation during the first 100 days focused on curbing production.
 - The Agricultural Adjustment Act, for example, was aimed primarily at farmers. To curb production, the act paid farmers to farm less land. Roosevelt also focused on the industrial sector. The National Industrial Recovery Act was the centerpiece of Roosevelt's New Deal legislation. Once again, the act attempted to prevent the overproduction of goods. Roosevelt, under the National Industrial Recovery Act, created the National Recovery Administration (NRA), which encouraged an increase in labor wages and a decrease in hours worked during a week. The solution worked for a brief period time, but a dip in the economy and the unwillingness of employers to enact important National Recovery Administration codes hurt the program.
 - While it was important to recover the economy, Roosevelt understood the New Deal had to establish programs that provided tangible relief for Americans. The legislation with the largest immediate impact was the Federal Emergency Relief Act, which dispensed millions of federal dollars to poor Americans. The act also created the Civil Works Administration, which employed individuals to work on government-related projects.
 - Similarly, the Unemployment Relief Act created the Civilian Conservation Corps, which provided jobs to men who were willing to complete environmental tasks. Roosevelt also passed the Home Owners Act, which refinanced mortgages to affordable rates and prevented Americans from losing their homes.
 - Another important piece of legislation was the Tennessee Valley Authority Act (TVA). This act allowed the federal government to develop the Tennessee Valley region into an area of prosperity. The government was able to do this by building hydroelectric dams, improving river transportation and developing industry. Not only did this program offer employment to Americans, but it generated low cost utilities and helped to curb land erosion.
 - We have seen that the Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, opposed the National Recovery Administration as an unconstitutional violation of the federal powers. The Court also nullified certain provisions in the Agricultural Adjustment Act as violations of the Commerce Clause, and they weren't the only group who opposed Roosevelt's New Deal legislation. Three prominent individuals, representing a populist ideology, vociferously voiced their discontent with the New Deal programs. Senator Huey Long believed that the Depression could not be ended through the expansion of the federal government but by redistributing wealth from the top. On the other hand, Reverend Charles Coughlin expressed his desire for social justice. In other words, Coughlin wanted aspects of the New Deal to be placed into the hands of the people because he thought it was being run by crooked financiers.
 - Then there was Francis Townsend, who promoted the Townsend Plan over the New Deal. The Townsend Plan's solution to the Great Depression was for every senior citizen to be granted $200 a month. Needless to say, most Americans rejected the ideas espoused by these three individuals. The labor movement also opposed Roosevelt, although they objected to the president's actions rather than the New Deal legislation. Labor believed that Roosevelt failed to force employers to comply with the laws established under the New Deal. As a result, thousands of strikes ensued throughout the United States. This ultimately led to the rise of radical labor political parties and the election of radical politicians to assume positions in Congress during 1934. Roosevelt would attempt to use the second New Deal to curb labor strife in the United States.


#### FDR Second New Deal
 - The Social Security Act was a magisterial achievement. There were two overarching goals of the Social Security Act. First, the program was expected to provide welfare funds for the elderly and the impoverished. The Social Security Act also established a pension program in addition to a monetary settlement for the deceased. Second, the legislation was designed to remove the elderly from the workforce by offering a financial aid package. This, in turn, led to more work being available to the unemployed. Unfortunately, the Social Security Act failed to account for farmers, sharecroppers and minorities.
 - Another landmark piece of legislation that was included in Roosevelt's second New Deal was the National Labor Relations Act, also known as the Wagner Act. Roosevelt structured this legislation to specifically curb the labor strife that was mounting in the United States. Under the National Labor Relations Act, every worker was promised the opportunity to join a union. The legislation also created the National Labor Relations Board to supervise union elections and mitigate unfair labor practices. Additionally, the National Labor Relations Act called for stiffer child labor laws, which eventually drove children from the workforce and opened additional opportunities for the unemployed. Yet, once again, the National Labor Relations Act failed to cover individuals such as farmers and minority workers. Now, Roosevelt promised that his second New Deal would be more Populist in nature. In other words, the second New Deal legislation would support the common man. To his credit, many of the additional pieces of legislation of the second New Deal created the image that Roosevelt was working toward social equality. The Holding Company Act was expected to break up electric utility companies; the Wealth Tax Act increased tax rates on the wealthy and corporations and the Banking Act strengthened the power of the Federal Reserve to monitor banking. The legislation seemed to be aimed at redistributing wealth and power, but, as we discussed earlier, Roosevelt's second New Deal program was more conservative in nature. Therefore, while all of the aforementioned legislation was passed, it was not as rigorous as it seemed. The wealthy managed to maintain most of their money, corporations were not taxed thoroughly and most businesses maintained their stranglehold on utilities and resources.
 - In 1935, the Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, challenged a number of Roosevelt's first New Deal legislation. In fact, the Court ruled that aspects of the Agricultural Adjustment Act violated the United States Commerce Clause and that the National Recovery Administration and its labor codes were unconstitutional because it violated the separation of federal powers. In 1937, the Supreme Court began investigating the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act for additional constitutional breaches. To avoid his legislation from being destroyed, Roosevelt attempted to 'pack the court.'
 - The court-packing plan witnessed Roosevelt campaign for Congressional approval to appoint one new justice for every Supreme Court member over the age of 70. Roosevelt argued that the aging Supreme Court members could not handle the volume of legislation being presented to them. In reality, Roosevelt was simply trying to add justices who were aligned with his New Deal legislation. Unexpected American outrage over the proposal quickly surfaced. Roosevelt then decided to withdraw his plan, yet, ironically, Justice Owen J. Roberts jumped onboard the New Deal legislation. As a result, the constitutionality of Roosevelt's second New Deal legislation was upheld by a vote of 5 to 4.

#### The Legacy of the New Deal
 - The most obvious legacies of the New Deal are the physical legacies left behind as a result of its programs. The most famous of these is the Hoover Dam, built to provide hydroelectric power to much of the Southwest, as well as flood control for farmers on the Colorado River. However, in terms of watts generated, that was tiny compared to the Tennessee Valley Authority, a plan by which dozens of dams were built along the waterways of the Southeast, most notably the Tennessee River, bringing development and electricity to one of the country's poorest regions. Large dams were not the only physical remnants of the New Deal. Across much of the country, similar architectural styles in public buildings, notably high school stadiums, is a direct result of the same blueprints being used to build municipal buildings by the Works Progress Administration. In fact, the Works Progress Administration also put artists and writers to work, leaving behind a rich aesthetic landscape from the 1930s. In more rural areas, the Civilian Conservation Corps built trails and lumber roads, allowing responsible use of natural resources.
 - However permanent the physical reminders have been, the political legacy of the New Deal is just as enduring. It was during the New Deal that many of the social welfare plans in use in the United States were established. Most notable of these is food stamps, a system by which poor citizens can afford food. For decades, this was thought of as the example of a non-controversial government program, as it benefited the poor, middle-class farmers and rich store owners. However, it has come under increasing fire in the 21st century as an unnecessary expense.
 - Yet, the biggest legacy of the New Deal has been in the ability of presidents of both major parties to reach into its memory for their own causes. Truman, Eisenhower and Johnson all made reference to the successes of the New Deal as justification for their own spending projects. More recently, the programs of the New Deal have proven much more controversial. Conservatives chide the program for having greatly increased the national debt. Others point to the vast growth of the Federal Government. At the other end of the spectrum, some liberals attack the New Deal for not having done enough to limit the runaway growth of big business that would occur in the years following World War II. In any case, all agree that the New Deal helped capitalism survive.
