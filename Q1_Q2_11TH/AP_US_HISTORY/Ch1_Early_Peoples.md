#### American Indian History Origin

 - There are several theories about how American Indians first made their way onto the American continent, however three are considered by historians most likely, they are: 
 - The Bering Land Bridge Theory, states that due to lower water levels in the last ice age about 20,000 years ago a temporary land bridge was created across the Bering sea, allowing hunter-gatherers to cross. 
 - The next is the Atlantic Theory, it is based on the fact that modern craftsmen have made boats using stone age tools, and spear points found in both Europe and the New World from thousands of years ago. 
 - The final theory is the Oceania theory, based upon the finding of a 9,500 year old skeleton in Washington State, with very similar facial structure to those people coming from Hokkaido, in Japan.


#### Mesoamerican civilizations 

 - Meso American civilizations are those we now categorize in and around the region of central America, the most notable of these being the Olmec, The Maya, and the Aztecs. 
 - The first great civilization of Mesoamerica is the Olmec. The Olmec were the first complex society in the region. Their name comes from what the Aztecs refer to them by: 'The Rubber People', or in the language of the Aztecs, 'The Olmec'. 
 - They inhabited a small area, but one with incredibly rich farmland allowing a large population for the time. The Olmec developed the first written language and numbering system in Mesoamerica. The Olmec built cities and acquired great wealth. It is looked to as the mother civilization for Mesoamerica.
 - The Maya flourished with their great cities from about 250 CE until around 1400. They covered southern Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They had a highly developed written language and mathematics, plus they had an amazing knowledge of astronomy. Their cities were amazing urban centers.
 - Unlike the Olmec and Maya, Westerners actually encountered Aztec culture in all its glory! The Aztecs lived in central Mexico. Their capital city was Tenochtitlan. Today, this is in Mexico City. The city was actually built on an island in a lake. The Aztecs emerged around 1325 and were conquered by Hernando Cortes in 1521. The Aztecs were advanced engineers and established the only true empire in Mesoamerica. They conquered many and received tribute, creating great wealth. So, how did a profit and glory-seeking conquistador like Cortes defeat this awesome empire so seemingly easily? The Westerners fit their preconception of their gods, and thus were largely welcomed at the beginning. The second factor is that diseases that Europeans had built of resistance to was highly effective at killing American Indians.

#### South American Civilizations

 - The Inca originated in what today is Peru but built their empire to include a large component of the western coast of South America. This region is in the heart of the Andes Mountains. The harsh, mountainous terrain made for some amazing architectural accomplishments and the development of amazing terraced fields know as step agriculture. 
 - Since around 1000 BCE there was development of tribal groups in Peru who began farming and over the centuries left great finds of carving, weaving, metal work and pottery.
 - The line of the Inca kings actually begins in the 12th century with Manco Capac, but what we know as the Inca Empire didn't really begin until a couple of centuries later when the Inca began conquering other peoples of the region under King Pachacutec. One common legend says that in 1430 (or around there), during a war with a neighboring tribe, Pachacutec's father and king was about to admit defeat in hope that his people would be spared the usual slaughter that followed anyone being conquered in the area. He prayed to the Incan gods, who apparently heeded his call and spurred him into battle, where he won.

#### North American Civilizations

 - The tribes of the Northeast lived in the territory from the Atlantic shores to the Mississippi Valley and from the Great Lakes to as far south as the Cumberland River in Tennessee. The people in this group include the Iroquois and Algonquian citizens. These tribes relied on each other for a very long time for trade but also spent a great deal of time as warring enemies.
 - The Northeast tribes cleared forests to plant crops and used the lumber to build homes and make tools. The women of many of these tribes did all of the work with crops, while the men primarily hunted and fished.
 - The Iroquois League is quite famous because it is believed that the coming together of the 13 colonies was based on this coming together of this group consisting of the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and the Mohawk tribes. The League of the Iroquois was feared by all other tribes of the region, and was a primary source for Benjamin Franklin as to a potential structure of the United States.
 - The Southeast cultural group stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Trinity River in what is today Texas and from the Gulf of Mexico north as far as points in modern-day Missouri, Kentucky, and West Virginia.
 - The Southeastern tribes settled in river valleys. They were first and foremost farmers with hunting and fishing coming in second as their source of sustenance. They lived in various styles of houses like in the pictures here. They included thatched roofs and various styles for the sides. This picture is of a house with plaster sides on a river cane frame. The Cherokee members call this type of home an asi.
 - The Southwest cultural group territory goes from the south of present-day Utah and Colorado down through Arizona and New Mexico. This includes parts of Texas, California, and Oklahoma and continues into Mexico. These tribes all have the dry climate binding them together.
 - Agrarian tribes like the Hopi and Zuni developed desert farming techniques that did not require irrigation. They relied on the little natural moisture the area does provide by using specific planting techniques and getting the crops in early in the season. They traditionally grew corn, beans, and squash. For meat, they also farmed turkeys and did some hunting.
 - The Northwest cultural groups followed the West Coast all the way from Northern California all the way up to the southernmost parts of Alaska.
 - Tribes of the Northwest Coast had oceans, rivers, and forests to offer up plenty of fish and game. Even with very little agriculture, the Northwest Coast Native American citizens had more than enough food to support a dense population. Because of the readily available food and building materials for their large plank houses and seaworthy boats, the tribes had time to achieve an affluent, highly complex society.
 - The Plains tribes covered much of the middle of what is today the U.S. and Canada. The Plains tribes are greatly tied to horse culture and the hunting of the buffalo, but, this lifestyle was not possible until the horse was introduced to the Americas by Europeans. Earlier, many of these tribal groups were hunter-gatherers and farmers who lived in villages or at least semi-permanent settlements. Many groups later moved into the Plains region to partake in the new buffalo-hunting horse culture.


#### Effects of European Colonization:
 - Disease was the biggest killer in the New World, with smallpox and cholera killing millions of people who had no natural immunity to it.
 - Steel was a massive power imbalance between those from Europe, and those from the new world. Without the right raw materials, knowledge, or conditions, they were unable to reproduce metal goods like knives and hatchets and fishhooks, leaving them completely dependent on trade and at a distinct disadvantage to the white people. 
 - It took less than a generation for horses to transform several tribes. They were the first beasts of burden in North America, enabling the transport of heavy loads for nomadic tribes. More importantly, horses can carry people. Hunters on horseback were much more efficient and could cover much more territory, and horses, of course, transformed the art of war.
