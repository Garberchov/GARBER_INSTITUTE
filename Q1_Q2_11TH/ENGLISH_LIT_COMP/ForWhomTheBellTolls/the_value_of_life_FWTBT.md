### The Value of Life in Hemingway's *For Whom the Bell Tolls*

The value of a human life is an intensely philosophical concept that has been argued over millennia, but in times of war with the spectre of death hanging closer over every person's head the topic gains new meaning. In his seminal work, *For Whom the Bell Tolls*, Ernest Hemingway delves deeply into the question using the backdrop of the family history of Robert Jordan, changing belief in the cause the Republicans are fighting for and imagery of the natural world they reside in. These seemingly unconnected factors are tied together by the conditions of the war and increase the intensity of conflicts between the characters, and ultimately brings about Hemingway's conclusion that the value of life is determined not by how long one lives, but what one does in that time.

The family history of Robert Jordan is not revealed at one moment throughout the story, instead coming through in small bits of information as the story progresses. The reader first thinks that these small nuggets of information about Robert Jordan's family and his motivations just serve to flesh out the character, but as the story progresses it becomes clear that these details are key to understanding where Jordan finds his inner strength and his conviction to fight. This is best shown when after Jordan's horse is shot out from under him and he has to make a decision between defeating the pain in the same manner his grandfather had or to be shot and surrender to it as his father had, "'Do you want me to shoot thee, ingles?'.... 'No hace falta,' Robert Jordan said, 'Get along. I am very well here." This inner strength, when the physical pain of his destroyed leg and the mental pain of losing both the love of his life and his own life just when he began to truly value them is unimaginable. However, instead of taking the easy option as his father had done and ending his suffering immediately he decides to take the noble path and continue the fight in the same way as he believes his grandfather would have done in his situation. The diametric opposites by which Robert Jordan views his grandfather and father allows them to be used symbolically as virtue and courage being equivalent to one, and selfishness and timidity the other.
