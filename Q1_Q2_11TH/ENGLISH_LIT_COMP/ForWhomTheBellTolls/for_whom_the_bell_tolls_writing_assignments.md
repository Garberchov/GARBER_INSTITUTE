 - Five Paragraph standard response form: 
    - Throughout FWTBT, Hemingway uses his characters to explore the theme of the value of life, assigning value to life, where one's life seems to have - or lack - value.  It is explored through the relationships of the characters (specifically, Jordan with his father & grandfather), the characters own actions and the vivid imagery of murder and violence which can be seen to question or underscore the necessity of such brutality in the course of life. 
    - Using the theme of the value of life, examine how Hemingway uses the setting, character's relationships, and the action of the novel to form a conclusion about the value - or to maintain indifference or ambivalence about it. 
    - Helpful guides:  use conversations, memories, scenery and take a position -- don't straddle the fence. It MAY be a progression where Hemingway is working through his feelings for the readers but lead me there by the end of the paper to what the theme is saying to the audience.

 - This is AFTER the FWTBT essay - so if essay 1 due let's say Thurs or Fri this week, this due by end of  next week. 
    - Both novels examine civil unrest, revolutionary and importantly, the characters involved in fostering that unrest and resolution. 
    - Compare and contrast Hemingway's treatment of civil war in FWTBT and Azuela's perspective on civil uprising in The Underdogs.   Similar situations - are the authors delivering the same message? How do the character developments support the author's purpose?  Which treatment is more effective in your opinion (but NOT in first person!) and WHY / HOW? 
    - This is like 6--7 paragraphs..  Use dialogue, setting, narrative plot points and/or transitions.  Remember not to treat each in a vacuum - I'd like to see how you view these IN COMPARISON to each other.
