#### Summary Session
Mariano Azuela, the author of *The Underdogs* lived a life that is reflected in the characters of his most famous novel. Azuela's feelings about the revolution are reflected in the actions of the main characters of the story, notably the enthusiasm and later lack thereof for revolution itself in Demetrio Macías as he leads his band as the honorable leader of the masses against the tyrannical rule of the government. Luis Cervantes represents the Azuela's idealism of the revolution, believing in the power of representation for the people and the cause they were fighting for and later the disillusionment of many who got into the fight for ideals, not plunder. War Paint is the anthesis of this, she represents the barbarism that disillusioned Azuela from the revolution and serves as the foil for the growing theme of savagery throughout the later parts of the story.

During his time as a doctor, he was a critic of the Díaz regime and when Díaz fled from the country he took up local positions as a civil servant but when Madero was assassinated he joined one of the traveling bands of rebels under Pancho Villa, who was largely the inspiration for Demetrio Macías. Macías, who is both a leader more out of circumstance than necessity, as when readers are introduced to his character it is when the Federales are threatening to rape his wife, he barges in and forces them away. The dialogue between Macías and his wife illustrates his understanding that he very well now had to go to war with them, "When they had gone, the woman drew close to Demetrio. 
'Holy Virgin, what agony! I suffered as though it was you they'd shot.'
'You go to father's house, quick!' Demetrio ordered. . . . . 'I've an idea the whole lot of them are coming.' 
'Why didn't you kill 'em?' 
'Their hour hasn't struck yet.'"
