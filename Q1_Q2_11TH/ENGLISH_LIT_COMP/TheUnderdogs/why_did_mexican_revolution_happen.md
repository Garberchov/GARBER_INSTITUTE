### Why did the Mexican Revolution Happen?

The Mexican Revolution, a conflict which arguably continued for two decades began with a call to arms and would later claim the lives of approximately 900,000 people is the backdrop in which *The Underdogs* is set. While the competing factions which vied for power against the dictator Porfirio Díaz had differing motivations and their leaders had specific goals for what should become of Mexico when they defeated Díaz, their anger centered almost entirely around two points. First, the elitist policies that disenfranchised poor farmers and workers in favor of the wealthy landowners and industrialists who propped up the Díaz regime, and the refusal of Díaz to commit to fair democratic purposes as he had said.  

The economic pressures on the lower classes was the main driving force for the revolution, while Mexico had gained its independence from Spain in 1821 the system of la encomienda which was implemented by Spanish colonizers centuries before had stayed in effect. These wealthy landowners who benefited from the encomienda system were the ones backing the Díaz regime, and the main drivers of the revolution wanted a modern capitalist economic system that benefited the workers in exchange for their labor.
