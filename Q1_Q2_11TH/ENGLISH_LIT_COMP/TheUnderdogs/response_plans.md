### Response Plans for The Underdogs

Assignments: 
1) SUMMARY SESSION: As you read The Underdogs by Mariano Azuela - do some light research on the Mexican Revolution. Using three sources (different types - speeches, encyclopedia, newspaper article, scholarly essays....) evaluate:   
....why did the Mexican Revolution occur? What type of government was in place? Was the revolt against the type of government or the people populating the government? Were there other social / economic / philosophic reasons for the Revolution? Discuss the "characters" giving important detail and -if relevant - the one/two major reasons (not broad strokes - be specific) with researched support for the revolution. 
Total writing: BULLET POINTS. 

2) SUMMARY SESSION:  CHARACTERIZATION.  Read some background on the life of the author Mariano Azuela.  As you read The Underdogs, where do you see Azuela's own life reflected in the character(s)? Give specific examples (reminder - this can be the "anti" Azuela as much as similar experiences.)  -Two- no more than three, paragraphs with TEXT CITINGS.  

3) SUMMARY SESSION: CHARACTERIZATION.  Part of the acclaim of the novel is tied to the character sketches.  Pick two characters - major or minor.  How is their characterization conveyed to the reader - and how does the characterization / character advance the story?  Do the characters chosen have something to gain - or to teach - each other? Are they each limited and able to become complete "persons" because of the existence of the other - or are they drawn fully into complementary or conflicting characters?  Two - Three paragraphs. 

4) SUMMARY SESSION: SETTING / TONE.   As you read the novel, discern the tone of the author.  Is he pro-war? Pro-revolution? Sentimental? Impartial? Boldly idealistic - or boldly realistic? Where in the text can you see this (cite passages).  Does the tone change as the course of the storyline progresses? Where do you see these changes - characters, settings, otherwise? 

5) WORLD VIEW/THEMES.  A little longer examination.  Discuss one major theme of the novel:  honor (and dishonor) -- how it is shown with  heroic (or anti- hero) symbolism in the novel and or the futility of power struggles in the guise of revolutionary activity.   Can honor survive war? Is there any true heroism in revolution? Is government all bad (or all good)? Can honorable men do dishonorable things?  SKETCH AN OUTLINE TO DISCUSS BEFORE WRITING.   five paragraphs (opening/three body/conclusion). 
....consider: Toward the end of The Underdogs, the government forces have machine guns.  This is a bold reminder of some anachronisms surrounding revolutionary uprisings.  What does the rise of modern warfare mean for revolutionary movements? Can they be successful and/or maintain their meaning? Are revolutions good - or bad - overall ?  
..... How does the fact that Macias is left to the audience as still fighting despite his certain death effect how the Revolution and the Revolutionaries are viewed - by the author and by the reader?
