### Garber Institute Custom Built World Literature Curriculum

World Literature: An Examination of Various Literary Texts from authors around the world, including fiction and non fiction, full length novels and smaller pieces


The goal of the unit is to: 
 1) examine the work for its own contributions: theme, characterization, plot development, use of language, text structure and composition elements, commentary on social and other prevailing issues
 2) examine the work relevant to its written time vs setting - in the locality of its development
 3) examine the work relevant to broader world events at the time of its release 
 4) compare the work to other assigned works: previously read; other source materials (articles, journals or other); newly assigned comparative works in different styles (e.g. novel vs biography; novels from different times from same geographic source; novel vs novel of same era from different geography)

Ultimately, the work is designed to broaden your base of types of literature examined, refine your writing skills based on specified prompts, and sharpen your critical thinking skills insofar as comparative literary styles / content can be utilized. 

Work to include:  textual summaries; thematic dissection; language/plot development; plus broader work to tie to world events, other texts, modern key points.
