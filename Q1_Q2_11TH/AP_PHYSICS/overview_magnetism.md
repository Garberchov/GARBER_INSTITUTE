#### What is a magnetic field?
 - The term 'magnetic field' basically refers to the space around a magnet where other magnets will experience a force. The problem is we can't detect the magnetic field with our own senses, so we need to use a compass to help us 'see' the field. A compass is nothing more than a tiny magnet suspended such that it can freely rotate in response to a magnetic field. Like all magnets, the needle has a north pole and a south pole that are attracted and repelled by the poles of other magnets. When the compass is placed in a strong magnetic field, the forces of attraction and repulsion turn the needle until it is perfectly aligned with the direction of the field.
 - Each one of the lines is called a field line, and it shows the direction of the magnetic field at various locations around the magnet. This diagram tells us a couple of different things. First, it shows us that the direction of the magnetic field is always considered to be coming out of the north pole and going into the south pole. This is really just a convention, but one that is universally followed. The second thing to notice is that the spacing of the lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field. We can see that the field lines are most closely spaced near the poles of the magnet (where the field is strongest) and spread farther apart as we move away from the poles. If you've ever played around with magnets, you've probably felt how much the force between two magnets changes as the poles get closer and closer together.

 - Most magnets do not start out as magnets at all, but rather turned into one after being exposed to a magnetic field. Materials that can become magnets belong to a special group known as ferromagnetic materials, which includes iron, nickel and cobalt. Ferromagnetic materials contain atoms that themselves are magnetic, but what makes them unique is that the atoms group together into magnetic domains. Within each domain, the atoms are aligned such that their magnetic fields unify to make the domain itself act like a magnet. However, if the domains throughout the material are randomly oriented, then the material will not behave as a magnet.
 - When exposed to an external magnetic field, such as that from another magnet, the domains will align with the field, causing a very strong magnetic response in the material. If the external field is strong enough, the domains will actually change shape, further enhancing the magnetizing effect. In most ferromagnetic materials, when the external magnetic field is removed, the domains will go back to their random orientations, and the material will lose its magnetism. This is a useful property for electromagnets that need to be turned on and off, like the ones used in wrecking yards.

#### How are magnetic fields created?
 - All magnetic fields are created by moving charged particles. Even the magnet on your fridge is magnetic because it contains electrons that are constantly moving around inside. The first indication that moving electric charges cause magnetic fields was discovered in the early 19th century. During an experiment, it was observed that when an electric current flowed through a wire, a nearby compass would change direction.
 - The 19th century experiment showed that a wire carrying an electric current is a magnet. Since the electrons all move through the wire in one direction, there is a well-defined magnetic field surrounding the wire. The strength of the magnetic field is proportional to the amount of current flowing through the wire. In other words, increasing the current increases the strength of the magnetic field. So, if wires are so magnetic, why don't we see paperclips and forks flying across the room and sticking to them? The reason is that the magnetic field just isn't very strong at normal, everyday levels of electric current. We'll need to do a bit more work to turn a wire into a useful magnet.
 - An electromagnet is a magnet that uses an electric current to generate its magnetic field. This differs from permanent magnets, like the ones on your refrigerator, which rely on the magnetic properties of the atoms in the material to create a magnetic field. At this point, our electromagnet is just a wire, but the magnetic field is too weak to do anything practical. However, if we bend the wire around and around to form a coil, the magnetic fields of the loops will concentrate in the center. To further enhance this effect, we can wrap multiple layers of wire on top of each other. Using more turns of wire increases the strength of the magnetic field. This is a definite improvement over our single wire from before, but it's still not strong enough to be really practical.

 - The degree of domain alignment depends on the strength of the magnetic field generated by the coil, which as we learned earlier can be controlled by the amount of current flowing through the wire. Just as importantly, when the current is turned off, the magnetic domains go back to their random configuration and the electromagnet loses nearly all of its magnetism. The ability to control a very powerful magnet with a switch has many practical applications.

#### Right-Hand Rule
 - all magnetic fields exert a certain amount of force upon electrically charged particles, called simply the magnetic force. The direction of magnetic force is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, which is also perpendicular to the direction of the electric current, or the flow of the charged particle.
 - How can three things be perpendicular to each other? Because we live in 3-dimensional space. So, you've got these three forces moving in three directions, and figuring out which is going where is actually as easy as raising your right hand. In physics, the right hand rules are tricks to determine the direction of magnetic force, current, or magnetic field using just your right hand
 - Let's look at our first right hand rule. This one is best used to determine the direction of magnetic force, assuming that you know the direction of the current and direction of magnetic field. So, here's how this works. Take your right hand. Point your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field. Now, since the current and magnetic field are perpendicular, make your thumb perpendicular to your fingers. Basically, you should look like you're about to shake someone's hand. Once your fingers and thumb are in place, you've created a flat plane. It's your palm. Now, if you imagine a straight line coming out from your palm perpendicular to the plane you created, that's the direction of magnetic force. For people who aren't great at imagining invisible lines, bend your index finger at the joint to create the perpendicular line coming out from the plane.
 - That first right hand rule is the most common, but there's actually another way we can use this same principle to determine the direction of a magnetic field around a current-carrying wire. This wire carries an electrical current and generates a magnetic field, but how do we know which way that field rotates? Easy. Take your right hand and point your thumb in the direction of the current. Now, wrap your fingers in a half circle around the wire. Just as a side note, depending on how well insulated the wire is, you may not want to actually touch it. Just saying. Now that you've done that, the direction of your fingers indicates the direction of the magnetic field. Basically, the magnetic field rotates counterclockwise perpendicular to the direction of the current. You've demonstrated that with your right hand.

#### Using the Lorentz Law
 - The magnetic field generated by a moving electric charge can be calculated using Equation 1, shown here:
  - []https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/b_equation_1.jpg() 
    - μo is a the permeability of free space equal to 4π x 10-7 Tesla-meter-per-amp (Tm/A)
    - q is the magnitude of the charge in coulombs (C)
    - v is velocity in meters-per-second (m/s)
    - r is the distance from the charge in meters (m)
    - θ is the angle between the direction of the charge's velocity and the distance to the point in question
 - This equation involves the cross-product, which is a way to multiply vectors that results in a vector that is perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge and distance from it.
 - The magnitude of the magnetic field is given by Equation 2, shown here:
 - [](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/b_equation_2.jpg)
 - Since the magnetic field is a vector, there must be a direction attached to its magnitude. We use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field at the point in question.

    - The right pointer finger points in the direction of the charged particle's velocity.
    - The right middle finger points in towards point where magnetic field is to be calculated.
    - The thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field at the point in question.
