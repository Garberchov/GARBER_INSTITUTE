#### What is a magnetic field?
 - The term 'magnetic field' basically refers to the space around a magnet where other magnets will experience a force. The problem is we can't detect the magnetic field with our own senses, so we need to use a compass to help us 'see' the field. A compass is nothing more than a tiny magnet suspended such that it can freely rotate in response to a magnetic field. Like all magnets, the needle has a north pole and a south pole that are attracted and repelled by the poles of other magnets. When the compass is placed in a strong magnetic field, the forces of attraction and repulsion turn the needle until it is perfectly aligned with the direction of the field.
 - Each one of the lines is called a field line, and it shows the direction of the magnetic field at various locations around the magnet. This diagram tells us a couple of different things. First, it shows us that the direction of the magnetic field is always considered to be coming out of the north pole and going into the south pole. This is really just a convention, but one that is universally followed. The second thing to notice is that the spacing of the lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field. We can see that the field lines are most closely spaced near the poles of the magnet (where the field is strongest) and spread farther apart as we move away from the poles. If you've ever played around with magnets, you've probably felt how much the force between two magnets changes as the poles get closer and closer together.

 - Most magnets do not start out as magnets at all, but rather turned into one after being exposed to a magnetic field. Materials that can become magnets belong to a special group known as ferromagnetic materials, which includes iron, nickel and cobalt. Ferromagnetic materials contain atoms that themselves are magnetic, but what makes them unique is that the atoms group together into magnetic domains. Within each domain, the atoms are aligned such that their magnetic fields unify to make the domain itself act like a magnet. However, if the domains throughout the material are randomly oriented, then the material will not behave as a magnet.
 - When exposed to an external magnetic field, such as that from another magnet, the domains will align with the field, causing a very strong magnetic response in the material. If the external field is strong enough, the domains will actually change shape, further enhancing the magnetizing effect. In most ferromagnetic materials, when the external magnetic field is removed, the domains will go back to their random orientations, and the material will lose its magnetism. This is a useful property for electromagnets that need to be turned on and off, like the ones used in wrecking yards.

#### How are magnetic fields created?
 - All magnetic fields are created by moving charged particles. Even the magnet on your fridge is magnetic because it contains electrons that are constantly moving around inside. The first indication that moving electric charges cause magnetic fields was discovered in the early 19th century. During an experiment, it was observed that when an electric current flowed through a wire, a nearby compass would change direction.
 - The 19th century experiment showed that a wire carrying an electric current is a magnet. Since the electrons all move through the wire in one direction, there is a well-defined magnetic field surrounding the wire. The strength of the magnetic field is proportional to the amount of current flowing through the wire. In other words, increasing the current increases the strength of the magnetic field. So, if wires are so magnetic, why don't we see paperclips and forks flying across the room and sticking to them? The reason is that the magnetic field just isn't very strong at normal, everyday levels of electric current. We'll need to do a bit more work to turn a wire into a useful magnet.
 - An electromagnet is a magnet that uses an electric current to generate its magnetic field. This differs from permanent magnets, like the ones on your refrigerator, which rely on the magnetic properties of the atoms in the material to create a magnetic field. At this point, our electromagnet is just a wire, but the magnetic field is too weak to do anything practical. However, if we bend the wire around and around to form a coil, the magnetic fields of the loops will concentrate in the center. To further enhance this effect, we can wrap multiple layers of wire on top of each other. Using more turns of wire increases the strength of the magnetic field. This is a definite improvement over our single wire from before, but it's still not strong enough to be really practical.

 - The degree of domain alignment depends on the strength of the magnetic field generated by the coil, which as we learned earlier can be controlled by the amount of current flowing through the wire. Just as importantly, when the current is turned off, the magnetic domains go back to their random configuration and the electromagnet loses nearly all of its magnetism. The ability to control a very powerful magnet with a switch has many practical applications.

#### Right-Hand Rule
 - all magnetic fields exert a certain amount of force upon electrically charged particles, called simply the magnetic force. The direction of magnetic force is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, which is also perpendicular to the direction of the electric current, or the flow of the charged particle.
 - How can three things be perpendicular to each other? Because we live in 3-dimensional space. So, you've got these three forces moving in three directions, and figuring out which is going where is actually as easy as raising your right hand. In physics, the right hand rules are tricks to determine the direction of magnetic force, current, or magnetic field using just your right hand
 - Let's look at our first right hand rule. This one is best used to determine the direction of magnetic force, assuming that you know the direction of the current and direction of magnetic field. So, here's how this works. Take your right hand. Point your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field. Now, since the current and magnetic field are perpendicular, make your thumb perpendicular to your fingers. Basically, you should look like you're about to shake someone's hand. Once your fingers and thumb are in place, you've created a flat plane. It's your palm. Now, if you imagine a straight line coming out from your palm perpendicular to the plane you created, that's the direction of magnetic force. For people who aren't great at imagining invisible lines, bend your index finger at the joint to create the perpendicular line coming out from the plane.
 - That first right hand rule is the most common, but there's actually another way we can use this same principle to determine the direction of a magnetic field around a current-carrying wire. This wire carries an electrical current and generates a magnetic field, but how do we know which way that field rotates? Easy. Take your right hand and point your thumb in the direction of the current. Now, wrap your fingers in a half circle around the wire. Just as a side note, depending on how well insulated the wire is, you may not want to actually touch it. Just saying. Now that you've done that, the direction of your fingers indicates the direction of the magnetic field. Basically, the magnetic field rotates counterclockwise perpendicular to the direction of the current. You've demonstrated that with your right hand.

#### Using the Lorentz Law
 - The magnetic field generated by a moving electric charge can be calculated using Equation 1, shown here:
  - []https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/b_equation_1.jpg() 
    - μo is a the permeability of free space equal to 4π x 10-7 Tesla-meter-per-amp (Tm/A)
    - q is the magnitude of the charge in coulombs (C)
    - v is velocity in meters-per-second (m/s)
    - r is the distance from the charge in meters (m)
    - θ is the angle between the direction of the charge's velocity and the distance to the point in question
 - This equation involves the cross-product, which is a way to multiply vectors that results in a vector that is perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge and distance from it.
 - The magnitude of the magnetic field is given by Equation 2, shown here:
 - [](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/b_equation_2.jpg)
 - Since the magnetic field is a vector, there must be a direction attached to its magnitude. We use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field at the point in question.
 - [](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/b_rhr.jpg)
    - The right pointer finger points in the direction of the charged particle's velocity.
    - The right middle finger points in towards point where magnetic field is to be calculated.
    - The thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field at the point in question.

#### The Biot-Savart Law
 - The Biot-Savart Law is an equation that describes the magnetic field created by a current-carrying wire, and allows you to calculate its strength at various points.
 - To derive this law, we first take this equation for the electric field. This is the full version, where we use muu-zero over 4pi instead of the electrostatic constant k. Since we're looking at a wire, we replace the charge q with I dl, which is the current in the wire, multiplied by a length element in the wire. Basically, it's treating this little chunk of the wire as our charge. And we also replace the electric field E with a magnetic field element dB because a moving charge produces a magnetic field, not an electric field.
 - Last of all, we have to realize that a current has a direction (unlike a charge). So we need to make sure the direction of the current affects our result. We do that by adding sine of the angle between the current and the radius. That way, if the wire is curvy, we'll take that into account. And that's it - that's the Biot-Savart law
 - Using the Biot-Savart Law requires calculus. That's why there's a dB and dl. Those are infinitesimal magnetic field elements and wire elements. So we'd have to integrate with respect to those elements. But we can use a simpler version of the law for a perfectly straight wire.
 - If we straighten out the wire and do some calculus, the law comes out as muu-zero I divided by 2pir. Or in other words, the magnetic field, B, measured in teslas is equal to the permeability of free space, muu-zero, which is always 1.26 x 10^-6, multiplied by the current going through the wire, I, measured in amps, divided by 2pi times the radius away from the wire, r, measured in meters. So this equation helps us figure out the magnetic field at a radius r from a straight wire carrying a current I.

 - The equation gives us the magnitude of the magnetic field, but a magnetic field is a vector, so what about the direction? The magnetic field created by a current-carrying wire takes the form of concentric circles. But we have to be able to figure out if those circles point clockwise or counter-clockwise (say, from above). To do that we use a right-hand rule.

#### Induction
 - The ability of one current-carrying conductor to induce a voltage in another conductor through a mutual magnetic field is known as mutual inductance. When an alternating electric current flows through a wire, it creates an alternating magnetic field around the wire. If we wrap this wire into the shape of a coil, we can concentrate the magnetic field into the coil's center and make it much stronger. We'll call this the primary coil. Now, if we were to bring a secondary coil of wire with the same number of turns into close proximity, the alternating magnetic field would induce a voltage approximately equal to that in the primary coil.
 - Getting a higher voltage out of a transformer than what we put in may seem like we're getting something for nothing, but we need to look at what happens to the current and power as well. When it comes to transformers, voltage and current are inversely related. In other words, if the secondary voltage is twice as much as the primary voltage, then the secondary current will be half as much as the primary current.
 - Because of this relationship, power, which is the product of current and voltage, is the same going into and out of the transformer. In a way, a transformer is similar to a lever used to move a really heavy object. While your small force at one end gets turned into a big force at the other end, your large movement also gets reduced to a small movement by the same amount. In the natural world, there is always a trade-off that keeps us from getting something for nothing.

 - Transformers are one of the most important applications of mutual inductance and can be found both outside and inside your home. Let's look at how they're used to send electricity from the power plant to your home. To minimize power loss in the long transmission lines, it is necessary to transmit the electricity at very high voltages, often in excess of 700,000 volts! The generators in the power plant generate much lower voltages, so the electricity has to be sent through a step-up transformer before it can be sent out to your house.
 - A step-up transformer simply has more turns in the secondary coil than in the primary coil, so the output voltage is higher. Once the electricity gets near your home, it is sent through a series of step-down transformers so that you don't have 700,000 volts coming out of the electrical sockets in your home.
