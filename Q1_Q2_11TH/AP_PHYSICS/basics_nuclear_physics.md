#### Radioactive Isotopes
 - Before we go into discussing radioactive isotopes, let's recall what an isotope is. Let's look at the picture of an atom below. It has a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons with electrons around the nucleus. All the atoms of an element have the same number of protons, but the number of their neutrons can differ. If this happens, then we can call these isotopes of an element. Isotopes have the same number of protons, but they differ in the number of neutrons.

 - Radioactive isotopes have an unstable nucleus that decays or emits excess energy or radiation until the nucleus becomes stable. They can be naturally occurring or artificial isotopes of an element.
 -There are many radioactive isotopes that are very beneficial in applications in medicine. For instance, radioactive isotopes are used for radiation therapy and for locating brain tumors.

 - Nowadays, it is standard for a home to have smoke detectors. These are installed in various areas inside our homes and go off when there is too much smoke. How does a smoke detector detect smoke? It is because inside a smoke detector unit, there is a small amount of a radioactive isotope called Americium-241.
 - Radioactive isotopes also play their part in research. Perhaps you've heard of carbon dating. This uses the carbon-14 radioactive isotope, which is valuable for archaeologists. This is very important in determining when the organism died, so it is very valuable in determining ages of fossils and organisms that are thousands of years old. Radioactive isotopes are also important in other aspects of research like the complex chemical processes of photosynthesis.

#### Types of Radioactive Decay
 - Did you know that less than 1% of all the radiation you are exposed to comes from the nuclear industry? Most of it comes from natural sources like rocks. You are even a little radioactive! Nuclear radiation comes from all kinds of different places. There is natural radiation from the sun, water, and even bananas. There are also man-made sources of radiation, like nuclear reactors, certain types of medicine, and the smoke detectors in your home.
 - As you may recall, the two particles that are found in the nucleus are the protons and neutrons. Because the atomic number of an element is the number of protons its atom has, a proton essentially has an atomic number of 1. It also has a mass number of 1 because its mass is almost exactly 1 amu. These two numbers are so important that sometimes they are included in certain notation. For example, when we are distinguishing the difference between three carbon isotopes, notice they all the sixes on the lower left of the symbol. Those sixes represent the number of protons (or the atomic number). They all have the same atomic number because they're all carbon. The top number is the mass number, which is the number of protons and neutrons, because both protons and neutrons have a mass of 1. Each of these three isotopes has the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

 - Now let's move on to the most common types of nuclear decay. The first is alpha decay. In alpha decay, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, or a particle containing two protons and two neutrons. The nucleus is said to decay, or change into one that is a little lighter, one with four less particles. An alpha particle can be represented a couple different ways - first, with 4, 2, and alpha symbol, the 4 representing the mass number (the number of protons plus neutrons) and the 2 representing the atomic number (the number of protons). Instead of the alpha symbol, the symbol for helium (He) is sometimes used because it's really just a helium nucleus.
 - Alpha particles are relatively heavy and quite slow-moving. It is for this reason that they can be blocked very easily by air, paper, clothing, and even your skin. Ingesting an alpha-particle emitter would be dangerous because your inner tissues don't provide the protection that your skin does and the alpha particles could cause some tissue damage. One of the main sources of alpha particles is the element radon, which is a gas found in many rocks.
 - Next up is beta decay or beta-minus decay. Beta decay occurs when a neutron turns into a proton and an electron is emitted. It can also be represented a couple of different ways. Both have a 0 and -1, and either a beta symbol or an e is shown. The reason an e is used is because a beta particle is really just a high-energy electron being emitted from a nucleus. Beta decay occurs when the nucleus contains too many neutrons. For example, tritium, the super-heavy isotope of hydrogen, has 2 neutrons and 1 proton (the most common form of hydrogen contains no neutrons). This tritium isotope is very unstable, and it will likely undergo beta decay, turning into a helium atom because one of its neutrons transforms into a proton and releases an electron. Unlike alpha particles, beta particles are high-energy and very light. They can travel through paper and certain types of clothing, but they are usually stopped by the first couple layers of your skin. To shield beta particles, a sheet of aluminum is needed. They can cause tissue damage, which is both good and bad. Damaging healthy cells can cause cancer; however, when beta particles damage cancer cells, they can provide a cure for cancer.
 - Finally, we have gamma decay. Gamma decay occurs when the nucleus of an atom is very high in energy. Just like electrons move out to higher energy levels, protons and neutrons can exist in higher energy levels as well. Also like electrons, when these particles fall back down into lower energy levels, radiation is released. When it is released from the nucleus by having protons and neutrons falling back down, very high energy gamma rays are released. Gamma rays are symbolized by a 0, 0, and a gamma symbol. Notice how both the atomic number and the mass number are 0. This means that this is a particle that contains no mass. It also doesn't change the atomic number of an element because the only thing that changes is that the nucleus loses energy. The structure of the atom is unchanged.
