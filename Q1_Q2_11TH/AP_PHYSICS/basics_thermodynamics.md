#### Temperature Units 
 - Temperature is defined as the measurement of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The hotter something is, the faster its particles are moving. A normal bulb thermometer usually contains a red liquid in a reservoir at the bottom. When this bulb is touching something warm, the fast particles in the warm substance hit the particles in the glass (or whatever your thermometer is made out of), and that causes them to speed up - and then they hit the particles in the red liquid, causing them to speed up. When the particles in the red liquid speed up, they space themselves apart more, causing the liquid to expand. This liquid needs a place to go, and in a thermometer, there is no place to go but up!
 - You may measure your temperature using the Fahrenheit scale, but the rest of the world uses the Celsius scale. If you know a temperature in Fahrenheit, you can convert it to Celsius using this equation: $°C = (5/9)(F - 32)$ This equation is rarely used in chemistry because chemists use the Celsius scale for measuring temperature.
 - The Celsius scale was created using the freezing and boiling temperatures of water at sea level as a standard. 0 °Celsius (or 32 °Fahrenheit) is the freezing point of water, and 100 °Celsius (or 212 °Fahrenheit) is the boiling point of water at sea level. There are 100 divisions (or degrees) in between these two points, and each division represents a degree Celsius. Now, because you may not use the Celsius scale on a daily basis, you can use the following poem to remember the relative temperatures and their corresponding degrees: 30 is hot, 20 is nice, 10 is cold, and zero is ice.
 -Normally in science, the Celsius scale is used. But on Ideal Island, a different scale is used: the Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is an absolute scale, meaning that 0 is the lowest temperature possible. If the temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, then the temperature where there is no molecular movement would be 0 Kelvin (K), or absolute zero. Currently, this temperature only exists in theory; it has never been reached, but scientists have come extremely close.

#### Changes in heat
 - Water, as well as other matter, can exist in three states, or phases, and we call them solid, liquid, and gas. As ice is heated, its temperature increases, and it melts into liquid water. Likewise, as liquid water is heated, it evaporates into water vapor. These changes from one phase to another are referred to as phase changes.
 - Did you know that the temperature of water doesn't increase when it boils? The water's temperature increases up to boiling and then remains constant as it boils. We will use diagrams that illustrate the relationship between temperature and heat to explain how this works. Before we do that, however, we need to describe the relationship between temperature and heat.
 - Temperature can be defined as the average kinetic energy of a substance, where energy is the ability to do work. Kinetic energy is energy of motion and thus reflects how fast an object is moving. The faster the object moves, the more kinetic energy it contains. The faster the molecules move that make up a substance, the greater the temperature of that substance.
 - Now, let's talk about heat. As substances are heated on a stove, in a microwave, or by the sun, energy is added to the substance. Heat can be defined as the total amount of energy contained within the substance. Where temperature reflects the average amount of kinetic energy, heat reflects the total energy. For example, two liters of boiling water have the same temperature as one liter of boiling water. However, two liters contain more heat - that is, more total energy.
 - Now, let's diagram temperature changes in water as heat is applied to the water. This will help us to understand the relationship between heat and temperature. Looking at the diagram below, you will see temperature along the y-axis and heat energy along the x-axis. You can see that the temperature increases as heat is added to water within a phase. In other words, the water molecules within ice move faster.
 - However, temperature doesn't change as heat is added during a phase change; for example, when the ice melts. During the phase change, the added heat doesn't make the molecules move faster, but rather further apart. The heat energy added during the phase change is used to overcome some of the forces that hold the molecules together, allowing them to move further away from each other. During the phase change, the added heat energy is stored as potential energy, or energy of position, as the molecules are now further apart. This is kind of like setting a mouse trap. Potential energy is stored in the mouse trap when it is set; in other words, when the position is changed.
 - As heat is applied to liquid water, the molecules move faster and the temperature again increases. During the phase change from liquid to gas, the added heat is stored in the molecules as, once again, potential energy, and the temperature remains constant. The added heat is used to overcome the remaining forces that hold the molecules together within the liquid. This allows the molecules to move even further apart and form a gas. Once again, the heat energy during the phase change is stored as potential energy.

 - Let's apply what we just learned about the relationship between temperature and heat to nature. Road crews will add salt to the road to melt the ice. As we just learned, adding heat to a substance causes it to melt, so how does salt cause solid ice to melt into liquid water? The answer is salt lowers the melting point of the water. The melting point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius. Salt water has a lower melting point, and the more salt that is added, the more the melting point will lower. Therefore, the temperature must be colder to freeze salt water. A common misconception is that salt actually warms up the ice and causes it to melt. Salt does not change the temperature of the ice; rather, the salt lowers the melting point of the water, causing the solid ice to melt.


#### Phase Changes and Heating Curves
 - In chemistry, phase refers to one of the four states that a substance can exist in; liquid, solid, gas, or plasma. A phase has uniform composition and properties. A phase change is when a substance changes from one phase to another. Every change has a different name. As you can see from the table, every state change has a process name.
 - State Change	Process	Example
         - solid --> liquid	melting	ice --> water
         - solid --> gas	sublimating	dry ice --> CO2 gas
         - liquid --> solid	freezing	water --> ice
         - liquid --> gas	vaporization	water --> water vapor
         - gas --> liquid	condensation	water vapor --> water
         - gas --> solid	deposition	water vapor --> ice
 - Freezing is when a liquid changes phase and becomes a solid, like when the water you put in the ice cube tray turns solid in the freezer. Freezing involves the loss of energy in the form of heat. At freezing, not only is there a loss of energy, but there is also an increase in the order of the particles in the substance.
 - Melting is the opposite, when a solid changes phase and becomes a liquid. Melting is when the ice in your drink turns to liquid Solid + energy --> liquid As a substance melts, it becomes less ordered.
 - At certain temperature and pressure conditions, some substances can't exist as liquids. In these conditions, a substance in solid phase will move directly to a gas without going through the liquid phase. When a substance changes phase directly from a solid to a gas, it is called sublimation. An example of sublimation is when dry ice turns directly into gas.
 - When the opposite happens, the change of state from a gas to a solid without going through the liquid phase, it is called deposition. An example of deposition is frost on a window.
 - The process of a substance in liquid phase going to a gas phase is called vaporization. During vaporization, molecules escape the surface tension at the surface of a liquid and enter a gas phase. Boiling is the changing of a liquid to a vapor or gas at boiling temperature. There is also evaporation, which is when particles escape the surface of a non-boiling liquid.
