### Overview of Gravity

#### The Acceleration of Gravity -->
 -  Free fall describes any motion involving a dropped object that is only acted on by gravity and no other forces. Gravity is the natural mutual attraction between physical bodies. Gravity is a very complex issue. The earth is attracted to you just like you are attracted to the earth. But, the earth has a mass much, much greater than yours
 - The magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity, denoted with a lower case g, is $9.8 m/s^2$.

#### Newton's Laws
 - Mass is a measure of how much matter an object contains, while weight is a measure of the force of gravity on the object. An object has the same composition, and therefore mass, regardless of its location. For example, a person with a mass of 70 kg on Earth has a mass of 70 kg in space as well as on the moon. However, that same person's weight is not the same since gravity is different in these locations.
  - So what is gravity? Gravity is the attractive pull between two objects that have mass. The strength of gravity is directly proportional to the amount of mass of each object. In other words, the larger the objects, the greater the gravitational attraction between them
  - Gravity is a force. A force is simply a push or a pull experienced by objects that interact with each other. The interaction can be direct or at a distance, which is the case of gravity. Newton's laws tell us that if an unbalanced force acts on an object, it will change the object's state of motion. In other words, the object will accelerate. Since gravity is a force, gravity causes objects to accelerate.
 - Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation says that every object exerts a gravitational force on every other object. The force is proportional to the masses of both objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this is given by $F = G*(m1*m2/d^2)$, where F is the force, G is the universal gravitational constant, m1 is the mass of object 1, m2 is the mass of object 2, and d is the distance between their centers.
 - The universal gravitational constant was discovered experimentally in 1798 by English physicist Henry Cavendish. It is measured in Newton-square meters per square kilogram $(N-m^2/kg^2)$ and is equal to$ 6.67 * 10^-11 N-m^2/kg^2$.
