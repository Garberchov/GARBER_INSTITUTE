#### Specific Gravity
 - The specific gravity is the ratio between the density of an object, and a reference substance. The specific gravity can tell us, based on its value, if the object will sink or float in our reference substance. Usually our reference substance is water which always has a density of 1 gram per milliliter or 1 gram per cubic centimeter. So, what is density, anyway? An object's density is a measure of how compact or heavy it is, in a given volume. We measure density in mass per unit volume which is written using measures like grams per milliliter (g/mL), grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm^3), or kilograms per liter (kg/L).
 - The formula for specific gravity, given that the reference substance is water is the density of the object divided by the density of water. The specific gravity has no unit because the units of the numerator and the denominator are the same, so they just cancel each other out. Let's look at an example. Here, the density of the object is 19 g/mL and the density of water is 1 g/mL. We cancel the unit g/mL because this unit is present in both the numerator and the denominator. The density is directly related to the mass of the object (unit: usually in grams but can be measured in kilograms or pounds), so the specific gravity can also be determined by dividing the mass of the object by the mass of the water. The mass itself is directly related to the weight of an object, measured in units called Newtons. So, the specific gravity can also be solved by dividing the weights of the object and the water.

#### Buoyancy
 - Buoyancy is an easy concept to understand if you know a little about pressure in a fluid. In a fluid (either a gas or a liquid), pressure increases with depth. So when an object is submerged in water, meaning that it is completely in that fluid, the pressure on the bottom of the object is greater than on the top. This creates a net upward force on the object, so the object is buoyed upward against gravity.
 - Not only does the buoyant force create an upward lift on an object in a fluid, but it's also equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by that object. This was discovered by Archimedes back in the 3rd century B.C., so we call this Archimedes' Principle. Again, it's important to remember that we're talking about fluids, so both liquids and gases, like water and air.
 - Archimedes' principle describes the relationship between the buoyant force and the volume of the displaced fluid, but also the density of the displaced fluid. The equation of this principle is $FB = ρf Vf g$ where FB is the buoyant force, ρf is the density of the displaced fluid, Vf is the volume of the displaced fluid, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.8 m/s^2. It's very important to remember that the density and volume in this equation refer to the displaced fluid, NOT the object submerged in it.

#### Pressure
- Let's go back to the unit that we use to represent pressure: psi. This is one of many different units that can be used to measure pressure, and it's probably the one that you use most on a daily basis in the United States. But, on Ideal Island, different units are used, so it's important to know what they are and how to convert among them. On the island, the most common units of pressure that are used are atmospheres (atm) and millimeters of mercury (mmHg). 1 atmosphere is often abbreviated as atm, and it's really just the weight of all of the air above you 'pressing down' on you while you stand at sea level. Now, if you were on a mountain, there would be less air 'pressing down' on you, so the pressure would be lower (less than 1 atmosphere). 
-The unit millimeters of mercury (mmHg) goes back to the device used to measure pressure, the barometer. In the barometer below, we have an inverted tube containing a column of mercury with the chemical symbol Hg, and it's sitting in a pool of mercury. As the atmosphere 'presses down' on the mercury pool, the liquid extends up into the inverted tube, and the height is measured in millimeters (or some other length measurement). So, if the weather is changing, resulting in an increase in the barometric pressure, the increase is measured by how far up the mercury extends in the column. At sea level, the mercury extends about 760 millimeters up the column.
