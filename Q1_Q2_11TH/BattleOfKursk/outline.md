### "Battle of Kursk" by David Glantz Outline

# Introduction
 - State what led to the establishment of the Kursk Salient, notably the Battle of Stalingrad and the following Soviet offensive: Operation Uranus. This was then followed by a German counteroffensive led by General von Manstein, leading to the victory at Kharkov and the establishment of a massive bulge in the German front line around the city of Kursk.
 - State what is different about Glantz's book compared to other books on the subject. Glantz's book more heavily focuses on the analytical, top down approach to the battle, whereas other books narrate the battle from the combined perspectives of individuals to form a coherent narrative. Glantz goes out of his way to debunk popular narratives of the battle, both relating to its importance and the role of individual events in its outcome.

# The Preparation Phase
 - Glantz challenges the popular narrative that had the battle been launched in early May it would have been an overwhelming German victory in the mold of Operation Barbarossa and Fall Blau. According to the popular narrative, the German's only held off attacking earlier due to Hitler's obsession with his Wunderwaffe(Wonder Weapons), notably including the Ferdinand tank destroyer and the Panther tank. Glantz, through the inclusion of both Soviet and German sources, proves that both sides were undergoing significant refitting and reorganization of their forces as both armies were considerably weakened by previous fighting.
