Do you think that the federal government IN THE UNITED STATES (not an idealized or other government) has enough, too much or just the right amount of power? Defend your answer.
Write this as an OP-ED / letter to the editor style response. You can use first person and you can be "reacting" to some global local event as the impetus. Be clear in the impetus, and PICK A SIDE ...don't waiver or equivocate. (this doesn't mean you have to be overly drum-banging unless you feel that way -  I'm not looking for two sides of an argument here. I'm LOOKING FOR YOUR ARGUMENT.) 
*If* you're feeling creative and engaged ..... love to see your response to: 

Outline a program that would get more people to vote in presidential elections or local elections.
The response should be 
.....IDENTIFY the PROBLEM with voter engagement.  (Just plain "apathy" isn't enough specificity...) 
.....DEFINE two methods to increase engagement. *If you'd like to instead design an ad whose aim is increasing voter participation...now THAT would be *****HOT*****!
