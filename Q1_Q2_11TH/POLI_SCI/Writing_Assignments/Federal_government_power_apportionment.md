### Does the Federal Government have the right amount of power?

The distribution of power between the Federal, State and Local governments has been an issue of contention since the Declaration of Independence was signed. The greatest issue of contention throughout the history of the United States of America is if the Federal Government has an outsized or undersized position of power in accordance with the overarching goals of the nation. It is my firm belief that the total power of the Federal Government is about the correct amount, but a series of reforms in the way that the Legislative and Executive branches function are necessary for an effective and nimble government to deal with the unique challenges of the 21st century. The most important of these reforms in the Legislative branch are age limits for members of congress, the elimination of the filibuster, the end of the two party system with the implementation of ranked choice voting. In the Executive branch a change in the way that departments work in accordance with the highly specialized nature of sub-departments and how this highly technical information makes it way up the decision making chain, along with working more efficiently in concert with state agencies.

While age limits for members of Congress has been a topic of discussion for decades, the salience of the issue has only increased as longer term threats to the future survival of not only the nation but the planet become top of mind for voters. The simple reality of older leaders not necessarily putting the same energy into fixing problems that will have their deadliest effects when they are gone has dramatically slowed American-and global-efforts in the fight against climate change along with giving validity to conspiracies that dispute its existence at all. This issue becomes further entrenched as lobbyists know that targeting the older members of Congress gives them a better chance of slowing down reform compared to younger members. Implementing an age limit would select for young, dynamic and innovative leaders that have the energy to build a better nation.

The elimination of the filibuster is a highly controversial topic that is almost always pushed by the side with their agenda being held up, the filibuster is an affront to the democratic principles of the legislative branch and has become a built-in function for slowing down the progress of government. The ability for legislation even the slightest bit contentious to be stopped dead save for "pork-barrel" concessions with just the threat of a filibuster dramatically increases spending and dilutes the intention of any given bill for causes not related in the slightest. Proponents paint imagery of lawmakers using the filibuster in a way reminiscent of the Spartans at Thermopylae, holding back the hordes as a bastion of the minority opinion but this is in no way supported by the common use of it. Most legislation that goes through the U.S. congress has goals that are agreed upon by both parties, and those issues which the parties disagree upon entirely are the main issues voters consider for elections every two years - it should not require a complete landslide for these issues to make it past the filibuster margin. There are very few issues that could motivate voters sufficiently to provoke that kind of overwhelming support, and the only majorities sufficient in recent history to get the most contentious issues passed-following September 11th, and Barack Obama's victory in 2008-were largely isolated. While the filibuster might have noble roots and rare uses that stem the tide of populism in favor of rational judgement, it is almost always used as a method of obstructing reform for political purposes.
