#### Assignment Rubric 
 - To combine with your online study of types of governments, using two of those types - republican and parliamentary representative democracies - please provide streamlined text to include: 
 - Simplified but clear definition of each that show their distinctive qualities, with the ideal (paper definition version) pros and cons of each;
 - Identifying global example of each and indicating it's roots in that country (is it a new democracy from an overthrown dictator? Or a 500 year old establishment?Or similar tale).... Why did they choose that form? YOU CANNOT USE U.S. AND U.K. !!! 
 - And doing some research  comment on when that form of government was perfect for an event in that country OR exactly the WRONG version ..... Could another form have been better ? Was the situation unique or the government flawed? 
 - Cite sources at the end.

Countries chosen: France, a semi-presidential unitary representative democracy(a relative outlier, though with some considerable benefits) and Israel - a parliamentary system with a number of smaller political parties and a coalition style.
