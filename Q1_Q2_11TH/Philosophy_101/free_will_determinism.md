### Free Will and Determinism

#### Free Will: Determinism, Compatibilism & Libertarianism
 - Let's start by discussing freedom. When speaking philosophically, there are two types of freedom, circumstantial and metaphysical. Circumstantial freedom is the liberty to accomplish an action without interference from obstacles. In short, it means you have the physical ability to get something done. For example, I have circumstantial freedom to jump up and down. However, if someone were to tie me to a chair, I'd lose this circumstantial freedom.
 - Differing from this, metaphysical freedom is the power to choose between opportunities. Usually being linked to intellect and ethics, it's the power to choose. It's the power of the self to select one opportunity or possibility over another.
 - When discussing freedom, philosophers sit in three different camps: the determinism camp, the compatibilism camp, and the libertarianism camp.
 - Often considered the most dogmatic of the three, determinism asserts that man may have circumstantial freedom, but he does not have metaphysical freedom. In other words, we may have the freedom to stand up and sit down, but we don't really have the freedom to choose a path in life. For this, we're at the mercy of our physical bodies and circumstance. Using its name as its definition, determinism asserts that man's path is predetermined. In other words, freedom is an illusion. When we think we're making choices, we're really just at the mercy of physical impulses or events which have already occurred(or have already been decided for us).
 - Of course, this type of hard determinism causes some serious ethical dilemmas. Most pointedly, if we're all just puppets on the path of existence, how can anyone ever be held responsible for their actions? How can we punish the criminal and elevate the saint? Under hard determinism, man can't be held responsible. 
 - Building on this question, many philosophers hold to the opposite of determinism, libertarianism. Also called indeterminism, libertarianism asserts that man has both circumstantial and metaphysical freedom. We aren't just puppets dangling from a string, nor are we subject to some predetermined path. We've got the capacity and intellect to choose between options.
 - Filling the gap between determinism and libertarianism is compatibilism. Also called soft determinism, compatibilism is rather easy to remember. It proclaims that determinism and libertarianism can be compatible.
 - Bridging the two, compatibilism sides with determinism in that it agrees actions can be predetermined in the metaphysical realm. However, it also gives a nod to libertarianism. On this side of the coin, compatibilism asserts we are all still responsible for the actions we perform through our circumstantial freedom.

#### Baron D'Holbach's 'Freedom is an Illusion' Theory
 - To begin, Baron d'Holbach was an 18th-century philosopher who espoused materialism. Materialism is the belief that only matter exists. There is no supernatural entity that somehow floats around as an unseen reality. There is only matter.
 - Materialists also believe that all matter is subject to physical laws. These laws determine how matter will act and react. In other words, matter is not free to just willy-nilly exist. Water can't decide to start moving upstream, and a wheel in motion can't just stop itself. Now, when talking about things like water and wheels, people didn't get too uptight. However, when men like Baron d'Holbach began applying their beliefs to humans, a few feathers started to ruffle.
 - This leads us to determinism. Determinism is the idea that, since all matter is subject to physical laws, there is no choice or freedom of will. Interestingly, determinism also includes human actions. This is seen in Baron d'Holbach's work The System of Nature. In this, he espoused that man, like matter, is governed by physical laws. In other words, just like a rolling wheel can't stop itself on a dime, we humans are just as bound by physical law.
 - Keeping things simple, the determinism argument goes something like this: Reality is made up of only matter. All this matter is subject to physical laws. No matter can escape them. Now, here's where we come in. Since humans are made up of matter, we, too, are subject to physical laws. Not only do we lack the power to control or manipulate the universe, we really don't even have the power to determine our own course in life. In other words, freedom is an illusion.
 - There isn't some mystical mind or consciousness leading us through life; all our actions are just impulses coming from a physical brain. Therefore, when we think we're actually making free will choices, we're really just responding to physiological impulses that will give us the best advantage to work within physical laws.

#### William James and Indeterminism 
 - indeterminism holds that not all events are predetermined. On the contrary, human life is rife with choice and possibility.
 - One famous proponent of indeterminism was William James, a 20th-century American philosopher. Summing up the beliefs of many indeterminist philosophers, James believed choice and freewill are all part of the human equation. In fact, choice only ceases to exist once a choice is made. Interestingly, and very unlike some of his deterministic counterparts, William James did not dogmatically espouse his beliefs. In fact, he openly admitted that he could not prove the existence of free will or choice. To him, the argument centers on possibilities. Since possibilities can't be poked, prodded, and measured by science, there can be no declared victor in the determinism versus indeterminism debate. As he said in 'The Dilemma of Determinism', 'We have not yet ascertained whether this be a world of chance or no: at most we have agreed that it seems so.'
