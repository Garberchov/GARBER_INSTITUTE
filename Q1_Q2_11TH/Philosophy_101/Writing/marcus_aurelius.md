### Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, and Stoicism 

# Foreword
This examination of Marcus Aurelius and his personal journal, today known as "Meditations", is being done with a modern translation of the work, specifically the 2003 Gregory Hays translation. This edition, one of many, was chosen for its readability and faithfulness to the original text. More than that, a large number of the quotes attributed to Marcus Aurelius come from this translation and so it is the one that is most familiar to the majority of readers. 
In the context of modern English, the word "stoic"(note the lowercase *s*) means " one apparently or professedly indifferent to pleasure or pain"(Merriam Webster). However in this context, Stoic(note the uppercase *S*) is used to describe, "a member of a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium about 300 b.c. holding that the wise man should be free from passion, unmoved by joy or grief, and submissive to natural law"(Merriam Webster). The lowercase version of the word has only tangential relation to the philosophy of the school of Stoicism, so conscious effort should be made to separate the two.

# Who was Marcus Aurelius?

Marcus Aurelius Antoninus born in 121 AD, and ruler of the Roman Empire from 161 to 180 AD was the last of the "Five Good Emperors" and the greatest embodiment of Plato's immortal call that, "States will never be happy until rulers become philosophers or philosophers become rulers."
