### Types of Fallacies

#### Begging the Question Fallacy
 - But when a person uses evidence that is just restating their claim, it's known as begging the question, a form of circular reasoning. This is an argument with a conclusion that appears as one of its premises. This is how people typically make a faulty argument by begging the question.'
 - A person starts off by stating that a certain thing is true, then they do not give any real evidence for that. Instead, they restate the same general information. So, no evidence is really given. No progress is made in the argument. A parent saying you have to listen to me because I said you should listen to me uses this fallacy.

#### Equivocation Fallacy
 - An equivocation fallacy involves using different meanings for a word or phrase at different points in the argument.
 - A helpful way to remember this fallacy is to think about equivocation as related to the words 'equivalent' or 'equal,' meaning the same or similar. The equivocation fallacy relies on the use of equivalent words or phrases that don't mean exactly the same thing, but are used as though they do to try to prove a point. 

#### Appeal to Popularity Fallacy
 - In philosophy, a fallacy called appeal to popularity is known to be a faulty approach to making an argument. You can tell this fallacy is being used when an argument relies on public opinion to determine what is true, right, or good.
 - Are there times when using popular opinion makes sense? Well, it's definitely possible that something that is a popular choice turns out to be a better choice.
