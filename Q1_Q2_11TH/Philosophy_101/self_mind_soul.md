#### Personal Identity
 - Personal identity is the concept you develop about yourself that evolves over the course of your life. This may include aspects of your life that you have no control over, such as where you grew up or the color of your skin, as well as choices you make in life, such as how you spend your time and what you believe. You demonstrate portions of your personal identity outwardly through what you wear and how you interact with other people. You may also keep some elements of your personal identity to yourself, even when these parts of yourself are very important.
 - When you ask yourself how you know you are the same person you were as a baby, this is a question of persistence. In this context, persistence means our existence across time and how we can prove it. In other words, we perceive that our self 'persists' through our life as the same human being, but how do we know for sure? The philosophers Plato and Ren√© Descartes, as well as many religions, have proposed that we persist because we have a soul, a timeless essence that continues in some form even after the death of our living, breathing human body.
 - Personal identity develops over time and can evolve, sometimes drastically, depending on what directions we take in our life. For instance, a person who at 25 identifies himself as part of a particular political party, of a particular faith, and who sees himself as upper-middle class, might discover that at 65, he's a very different person. Perhaps he's no longer interested in politics, he's changed his religion, and he's living on less money than when he was 25. Any variation is possible during a person's life span.
 - According to the philosopher David Hume, living life as a human being leaves only impressions, rather than one stable identity or sense of self. These impressions are the changing, shifting elements of our existence. Think of the various ways you have looked at the world throughout your life. You've had a set of experiences and have changed because of them. Hume argued that due to the unstable nature of impressions, personal identity cannot be said to persist through time. We perceive a sense of self because of the way our mind put impressions together and makes sense of them as 'me.'
 - Hume challenged earlier ideas about persistence and the psychological and physical continuity theories that had come before him. Physical continuity theory had looked at how we have the same human body we have had during our life and that this helps us know we are ourselves. Psychological continuity theory had focused on how the mind and memories seem to tie a person's identity together. Hume questioned these theories that talked of an enduring personal identity. Instead, he pointed to the fleeting nature of our experiences and how we are ever-changing.

#### The Mind-Body Problem
 - Dualism is the concept that reality or existence is divided into two parts. When speaking philosophically about humans, these two parts are often identified as the mind and the physical body. According to dualism, the mind is somehow separate from the physical attributes of the body.
 - In dualism, the mind is part of the unseen world. Being a bit gross, if you opened up a human skull you could see, touch, and smell the human brain. However, try as you might, you would not find a mind. According to dualism, it is a separate entity or reality. Using this idea, the very famous Descartes asserted the mind is the seat of our consciousness. This mind is where we find our emotions, our will, our intellect, and our passions. For this reason, our identity comes from the mind. Summing this up, Descartes would say, 'I think, therefore I am!'
 - Standing opposed to dualism in the mind-body argument is materialism. Materialism is the belief that nothing but matter exists. In other words, if you can't experience it with your senses, it's not part of reality. Using these parameters, materialism holds that the mind does not exist. We can't see, touch, or taste it so it's on the same plane as myth.
 - For many who espouse materialism, what we call the mind is really just a collection of physical processes. For instance, materialism would argue that when a person is depressed, it has nothing to do with what's going on in some mystical mind. It's just brain chemicals misfiring.
 - One proponent of materialism who really challenged the concept of dualism was Gilbert Ryle. He actually thought the idea of a mind controlling the physical body to be as absurd as ghosts operating machines.
 - Paul Churchland, another philosopher who espouses materialism, uses traumatic brain injury to argue against the mind as the seat of identity. Summing up his arguments, he asks, 'If the mind is the seat of identity, why does brain injury alter a person's personality?'
 - If the mind was a bona fide separate thing, wouldn't it preserve a person's sense of self, regardless of damage to a physical organ? However, since brain injury often does modify a person's personality, Churchland asserts everything we call self does not originate in the mind. It comes from the physical working of a very physical brain.

#### The Immortal Soul: Socrates, Plato, Augustine
 - Being the earliest of the three, we'll start with Socrates. Admittedly, much of what we know about Socrates is conjecture. Keeping our summary of his views rather general, he believed the soul is immortal. For this reason, he asserted that death is not the end of existence. Death is simply the separation of the soul from the body.
 - As a supposed student of Socrates, Plato agreed that the soul is immortal and separate from the body. However, he upped the ante a bit. He believed the soul was eternal. According to Plato, the soul doesn't come into existence with the body; it exists prior to being joined to the body.
 - Sounding a whole bunch like reincarnation, Plato believed the soul exists within a body until that body dies. It then sets up house in another body. For this reason, Plato called the body the prison of the soul.
 - As our last dualistic thinker of the day, Augustine also believed the soul to be immortal. However, he believed the soul AND the body make up a human. The body isn't just a prison for a soul that jumps from body to body. Instead, one body and one soul make up one person. Yes, he agreed that the soul is immortal; he just didn't buy into the idea that it hops from body to body.
 - Being a bit cryptic and heady, Augustine asserted the soul is immortal because it possesses truth. Stating it as simply as I can: Augustine argued the human soul is capable of scientific reason and truth.
