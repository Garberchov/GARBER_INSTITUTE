### Philosophical Knowledge Across Culture

#### How Philosophy Understands Knowledge Cross-Culturally 
 - If you take a philosophy course in the United States, you might notice something about these classes. Most of the philosophers you'll learn about originated in Europe. You might start with the ancient Greeks and then learn about philosophers from other areas of Europe, the United States, and possibly the Middle East.
 - What about the rest of the world, you might wonder? Why is academic philosophy so focused on these traditions at the exclusion of other regions? Is philosophy magically something that only evolved in Western Europe? No, it's just that western philosophy is highly correlated with the culture and history of the West(and the United States notably, John Adams wanted the seal of the United States to be Hercules at the crossroads.)
 - Why is this important to discuss? Well, focusing only on philosophers from your own region of the world could give you the skewed idea that philosophers only emerged in those areas, or that somehow knowledge in one region is the standard, while knowledge of any other region is the other.
 - As Argentine-Mexican philosopher Enrique Dussel argues, you're also missing out on an opportunity to learn how people around the world have attempted to address what he calls the core problems of philosophy - questions like, 'Why do we exist?' and 'What is the nature of reality?' These are questions we all have in common as human beings, he argues.
 - As in many areas of society, both here and elsewhere, racism and chauvinism have played a role in determining which ideas are valued the most, whether conscious or unconscious. Normative chauvinism, according to American philosopher Martha Nussbaum, involves the view that one's own tradition of philosophy is the best and only way to approach philosophy. Historically, ideas that came from other regions of the world were both unfamiliar and suspect, as were the contributions of women and people of color. Many argue these have been blind spots of academic philosophy and that this legacy continues today. After all, what we know as academic philosophy has been taught in a particular way for many years, and it takes time and effort to change that.
 - For instance, think of a concept such as justice or freedom. If you were raised in a culture that values these concepts above many others, thinking about these concepts may seem natural to you.
 - Now imagine you are given a text to read from a philosopher that has a completely different worldview about how knowledge is obtained or doesn't express the concept of freedom in the same way as you have understood this idea your whole life. You may struggle to understand this text until you've learned the cultural context or even portions of a language unfamiliar to you.
 - Imagine again, for instance, that all of your training in philosophy has taught you to look for an argumentative style and in another region's philosophy, you don't see this pattern in how they arrive at the truth. Instead, you see a poetic style. How do you analyze this argument as you would others? Perhaps new skills are needed to do this and new research.
 - This is where the approach of comparative philosophy can help the larger field evolve. Comparative philosophy involves the study of thinkers from a variety of traditions and geographic regions. The purpose is not just to describe those different approaches; the purpose is also to bring philosophers into conversation about how different traditions understand knowledge and reality and to think about how well they address the core problems of philosophy.
