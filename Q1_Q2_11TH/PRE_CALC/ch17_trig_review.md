### Trigonometric Functions & Graphs Review

#### Sine & Cosine
 - Sine equals the opposite over the hypotenuse. If I go back to my unit circle, then my hypotenuse has a length of 1. My opposite edge has a length of y. So sine theta in the unit circle equals y. This helps us in graphing sine theta. So let's draw a graph - sine theta as a function of theta.

 - Cosine is equal to the adjacent edge divided by the hypotenuse. In our unit circle this is x divided by 1, or just x. I can do the same thing - what happens to x as I go around this circle counterclockwise?

 - Tangent theta is equal to the opposite edge divided by the adjacent edge. It's harder because we aren't using 1 at all in this, we're using x and y, so tangent of theta in our unit circle is y divided by x, or sine divided by cosine.

#### Unit Circle
 - For trigonometric calculations, the most important thing you can memorize is the unit circle. The unit circle contains several useful angles along with their x and y coordinates.
 - Memorizing the unit circle can be extremely helpful because, if you have it memorized, you can calculate the trig values of the angles without a calculator. You can even go backwards by taking a trig value and finding the angle that created it.
 - The first quadrant angles range from zero degrees to 90 degrees. To get angles in between, we split it in half and in thirds. This gives us angles of zero, 30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees. Now that we know the degree measures for the angles, we need to write the radian measures. You can convert all the degree measures into radian measures by multiplying them by 2pi/360.
 - Zero multiplied by anything is zero, so that angle is zero radians. 90*2pi/360 simplifies to pi/2 radians. For the other three angles, you can convert or you can use a pattern. Take the first number from the angle in degrees and put pi over them. Reverse the order and you have pi/6, pi/4, and pi/3.
 - Knowing the angles is the first step, but to be able to do calculations, we have to know the x and y coordinates for each angle. Again, we will start with the zero and 90 degree angles. These are straightforward. The coordinates are read directly off the graph. The point for a zero angle on the unit circle is the point (1,0). The point for a 90 degree or pi/2 radian angle is the point (0,1).

#### Special Right Triangles
 - The first special right triangle is the 30-60-90 triangle.
 - So, what is special? The ratio of the side lengths. If the hypotenuse is 2, the short leg is 1, and the long leg is the square root of 3.
 - So, how do you remember which is which? Just think about the logical relative length of the sides. The short leg is the shortest side, so that's your 1. And the long leg is opposite the 60-degree angle, which makes it the middle one, so that's your square root of 3. Finally, the hypotenuse is the longest, and it's opposite the largest angle, so that's your 2.
 - our 45-45-90 triangle is less stylish but easier to work with
 - It's an isosceles triangle! And it's the only kind of isosceles right triangle you can make. Now, what's great about isosceles triangles? The two legs are always the same. That makes finding the hypotenuse easy if you just know one of the legs - just use the Pythagorean Theorem.
