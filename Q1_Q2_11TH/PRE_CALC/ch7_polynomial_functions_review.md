 - The previous graphs were all simple forms of a more complex graphing process. Most of the graphs we will look at have a whole bunch of hills and valleys called local maximums and local minimums. To graph an equation that is more complex, we will need to know where the hills and valleys occur. A relative local maximum is the highest bump in a graph; we can think of this as a hill. A relative local minimum is the lowest bump on the graph; we can think of this as a valley.
 - Let's see what these type of graphs look like. Let's look at the graph of $y = x^3 + 3x^2 - 16x - 48$. As you can see, the highest bump in the graph is our local max, or hill. It isn't our maximum point because the graph goes up to infinity on the end of our graph here. So it is our local max. We can also notice local minimum, or the valley. The minimum is not an absolute minimum because the graph goes down to negative infinity here.
 - Think gradient descent in machine learning algorithms for local maximum and minimum, gives you a pretty good aproximation of what the absolute max/min might be

#### Pascal's triangle
 - ![](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/pascals_triangle_1.png)
 - $(x + 1)^0 = 1$
 - $(x + 1)^1 = 1x + 1$
 - $(x + 1)^2 = 1x^2 + 2x + 1$
 - $(x + 1)^3 = 1x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1$
 -$ (x + 1)^4 = 1x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1$
 - These line up exactly with pascals triangle, This illustration makes the pattern pretty easy to see. If you wanted to expand (x + 1)^5, you would just need to add another line to the triangle: 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1. Thus the expansion is x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 + 5x + 1. All you have to remember is to decrease the exponents for each term, and the rest is done for you in the triangle!
