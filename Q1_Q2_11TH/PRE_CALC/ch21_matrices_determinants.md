#### How to solve Inverse Matrices
- The identity matrix is the square matrix that has ones on its diagonal and zeros everywhere else. Think of the identity matrix as the number 1 in the matrix world.

- Do you see how each of these identity matrices are all square, meaning that they have the same number of rows and columns? Also, all the numbers are 0 except the numbers making up the diagonal, which are all 1s. The diagonal is the line that starts at the upper left of the matrix and ends at the bottom right.
- These are called identity matrices because matrices that are multiplied by their matching sized identity matrix will produce the original matrix. We label an identity matrix with a capital I. So, matrix A multiplied by its identity matrix I will equal matrix A.
- Now that we've covered the identity matrix, we can now talk about the inverse matrix. We label inverse matrices with a superscript of -1. So the inverse matrix is defined as the inverse matrix that meets the criteria of A * A sup -1 = I, where A stands for a matrix A, A sup -1 stands for the inverse of matrix A, and I stands for the identity matrix.
- Yes, if we multiply a matrix by its inverse, then we will get the identity matrix as our answer. This is just like when we multiply a whole number by its inverse, we get the number 1. For example, 1/9 is the inverse of 9. When we multiply them together, we get 1. We can also write 1/9 as 9 sup -1.
- Inverse matrices are important in the matrix world because we can't divide in the matrix world. But by using an inverse matrix, we are essentially dividing. To link this to the real world, think of the the inverse of the number 9, 1/9. Aren't we dividing by 9?

- To find the inverse of a particular matrix, we are going to write our matrix and its matching sized identity matrix right next to each other in one big matrix. [A | I]. Then, we are going to use matrix operations to change the first matrix into the identity matrix. What used to be the identity matrix on the right side will now be the inverse matrix. [I | A sup -1]. 

#### Solve Linear Systems using Gaussian Elimination
 - In math, we come across equations by themselves with just one variable that we have to solve. And then we have linear systems, a collection of linear equations. Your linear equations are equations with variables that have no exponents. So 3x + 4x = 5 is an example of a linear equation, as is x + 3y - 4z = 3.
 - We need one equation for each variable in our system in order to solve the system. So if we have two variables, we need two equations. If we have three variables, then we need three equations, and so on. In this video lesson, we will learn about using Gaussian elimination, a method to solve a system of equations, to help us solve our linear system. This method requires us to know how to turn our linear system into matrix form and then use simple matrix manipulations. Let's look at solving this linear system using Gaussian elimination:

 - Remember that a matrix is just a rectangular array of values put into rows and columns. We first need to turn our linear system into matrix form by turning it into an augmented matrix. An augmented matrix is the combination of two matrices. In our case, we have a matrix for the coefficients of the left side of the equation and another for the right side of the equation.
 - Our linear system is already organized properly, so all we need to do is to isolate our coefficients. Our first row will have 1, 1, 1, | and then 5. Our second row has 2, 0, -1, | and 4. Our third row has 0, 3, 1, | and 2. Our matrix looks like this:
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/equationgaussianelimination5.jpg)
 - We can now use Gaussian elimination to help us solve this linear system. Gaussian elimination is about manipulating the augmented matrix until we have the matrix that represents the left side of the equations in upper triangular form. What this means is that we want all zeros below the main diagonal. This main diagonal starts at the top left and ends on the bottom right of the coefficients matrix. In other words, we want to manipulate the matrix so the 2 on the second row and the 0 and 3 on the third row are all 0s.
 - To change these numbers into 0s, we are going to use our matrix row operations. To turn our first 2 into a 0, we multiply our first row by a -2 and then we add it to the second row to create a new second row. We get a new second row of 0, -2, -3, | and -6. Now, to change the 3 in the third row into a 0, we will use this new second row combined with the third row. We will multiply the second row by 3 and add it to the third row multiplied by 2. We get a new third row of 0, 0, -7, | and -14.
 - Notice how easy it is to solve now. If we write out our linear equations, we get x + y + z = 5, -2y - 3z = -6, and -7z = -14. We can immediately solve the third equation for z to get z = -14/-7 = 2. We can then substitute this value for z into the second equation to solve for the next variable, y. We get -2y - 3(2) = -6. This turns into -2y - 6 = -6. To solve for y, we add 6 to both sides and we get -2y = 0. Dividing both sides by -2, we get y = 0. So now we have y = 0 and z = 2. To solve our last variable, x, we can use our very first equation. Plugging in these two values, we get x + 0 + 2 = 5. Solving this for x, we get x = 3. So our final answer is x = 3, y = 0, and z = 2. We can also write this in point form, like this: (3, 0, 2).
