#### Graphing Ellipses
 - Just like with circles, an ellipse has a center. Unlike circles, an ellipse has two different measurements for its radius, which is the distance from the edge to the center. Notice how an ellipse is longer in one direction than the other? Because of this, an ellipse will have a radius measurement for one direction and another radius measurement for the other direction. Our equation of an ellipse takes into account all of these measurements. Our equation is (x - h)^2 / a^2 + (y - k)^2 / b^2 = 1, where (h, k) is the center of our ellipse, a is the radius in the horizontal direction, and b is the radius in the vertical direction. Notice that there is always a plus in between the x and y parts of the equation and that the equation always equals 1.
 - For example, if an ellipse had an equation of x^2 / 4 + y^2 / 9 = 1 then the center is 0, 0 because there are no subtraction or addition parts. In this case, a=2 and b = 3. Meaning it stretches two to the right and left, and three to the up and down. This is then easily drawn.
