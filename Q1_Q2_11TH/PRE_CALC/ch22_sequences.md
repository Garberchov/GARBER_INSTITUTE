#### Introduction to Sequences
 - What is a sequence? A sequence is a string(different from a string in programming) of things in order. Because sequences have order, we can usually find a rule or pattern that fits.
 - First, we have finite sequences, sequences that end. These sequences have a limited number of items in them. For example, our sequence of counting numbers up to 10 is a finite sequence because it ends at 10. We write our sequence with curly brackets and commas between the numbers like this: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. You can see that this sequence has order to it. It begins with a 1 and goes up by ones. Each number is the previous number plus 1.
 - We can also have a finite sequence made up of other things besides numbers. It can be an ordered sequence of letters, for example. Our alphabet is a finite sequence beginning with a and ending with z: {a, b, c, . . .x, y, z}. It has an order that we understand. We can also make a finite sequence out of names. For example, the name Sarah can be made into the sequence {s, a, r, a, h}, which contains all the letters in the name in order.
 - And this takes us to infinite sequences, which are sequences that keep on going and going. They have no end. For example, our counting numbers is an infinite sequence because it has no end. We can keep on counting forever. We write infinite sequences with the first few numbers to show the pattern and then with three periods in a row to show that it keeps going, like this: {1, 2, 3, 4...}.
 - The possibilities here are endless as well. We can have an infinite sequence of alternating zeroes and ones: {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1...}. We can have an infinite sequence where each number is half of the previous number: {16, 8, 4, 2...}. We can have an infinite sequence of all the multiples of 5: {5, 10, 15, 20, 25...}.
 - Why is it important to learn about sequences such as these? It is important to learn about these sequences, both the ones that end and the ones that don't, because understanding them will help us solve problems that involve these sequences. Math problems that involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, for example, all require us to understand the sequence that is the number line. We need to know the order on the number line so we can add and subtract. Sometimes our problems will even ask us to write our sequences.

#### Series and Summation notation
 - Sequences are strings of numbers with a pattern. Examples of sequences include our counting numbers, our even numbers, our odd numbers and so on. Anything with a pattern is a sequence. We can even count by 10s and we would have a sequence because we have a pattern. We can also have a sequence where we multiply each number by the same number, 2, for example, to get to the next number. We write our sequences inside curly brackets with commas between the numbers. For example, we write our odd numbers as {1, 3, 5, 7, . . .} and our multiplication by 2s as {1, 2, 4, 8, . . .}.
 - If we take the sum of a sequence, we have what is called a series. We take the sum of a sequence when we want to find out the total of a sequence. This sum is useful in terms of statistics. When we take the sum, we are simply adding our numbers in our sequence together. So for our sequence of odd numbers, the series would be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 and so on.
 - While we can write out our series using addition, it is easier to use the Sigma notation to represent our series. The Sigma notation is another way to say 'sum.' It is also referred to as summation notation. This notation looks like a big sideways M. On the bottom of the symbol, we have little letters that tell us our beginning point. On the top of the symbol, there is a little number that tells us our end point. To the right of the symbol, we have a formula for our sequence. For example, our counting numbers have the simple formula of n.
 - Let's go ahead and use this Sigma notation now. We see that our beginning point is n = 1. So, to find our first number that we will be adding to, we plug in this value of n into the formula to the right of the Sigma symbol. To find the second number to add, we increase our value of n by 1, so that now n = 2, and we plug this value into the formula. We repeat this process for the next number, increasing n by 1 again, so now n = 3. We keep repeating until we reach the number at the top of the symbol, when n = 10. That is the last number we are adding. We end up with the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10. To finish, we add up all these numbers to get our answer of 55.
