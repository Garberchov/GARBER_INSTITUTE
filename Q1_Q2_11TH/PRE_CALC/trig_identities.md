#### List of Basic Trig Identities
	- In this lesson, we will learn and memorize the three basic trig identities. These are sometimes referred to as the Pythagorean identities. Sometimes we can be given equations and expressions that look like a jumbled mess. It's usually better if we can organize everything. Pythagorean identities help us group things together in specific ways that simplify them. Simplifying and organizing equations can be very helpful.
	- If we took a look at the unit circle and chose a point, we could draw a right triangle from it. Let's begin by taking a look at a basic right triangle and see if we can relate it to a trig identity. The hypotenuse is 1, and we know that if we square and add the two legs, they will add to 1. Because we are on the unit circle, we can give the angle that we formed a name. That angle could vary depending on the triangle we drew, so we'll just call it theta.
	- If we took a look at this triangle, we could see that x^2 + y^2 = 1^2 or just 1. More importantly, because we are on the unit circle, we can rename the x and y values to their trigonometric values. To get the x value of an angle, we take cos(θ), and to get the y value of an angle, we take sin(θ). This allows us to simplify the Pythagorean theorem to just use one angle. Since we replaced the variables with their trig values, our formula simplifies into sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1.

	- We start with sin^2 (θ) + cos^2 (θ) = 1. Let's divide each part of this formula by the first term to see what happens: sin^2 (θ) / sin^2 (θ) = 1. Let's move on to the second term. We keep the plus sign. Cos^2 (θ) / sin^2 (θ) gives us cot^2 (θ). We keep the equals sign and move on to the last term: 1 / sin^2 (θ) gives us csc^2 (θ). Just like that we have an identity with two of the other trig functions: 1 + cot^2 (θ) = csc^2 (θ).
	- Let's go back to the original equation, sin^2 (θ) + cos^2 (θ) = 1, and see if we can come up with the other identity. Last time we divided everything by the first term. This time we want to divide everything by the second term, which is cos^2. Sin^2 (θ) / cos^2 (θ) gives us tan^2 (θ). We keep the plus sign. Cos^2 (θ) / cos^2 (θ) = 1. We keep the equals sign. And we'll move to the last term: 1 / cos^2 (θ) = sec^2 (θ). That's the last of our Pythagorean identities: tan^2 (θ) + 1 = sec^2 (θ).

#### Alternate Forms
	- Recall that all of trigonometry begins with just two functions, the sine and cosine. The rest can be found from these two functions. We have our tangent function equal to sine over cosine. Then we also have cosecant equal to 1 over sine. Secant is 1 over cosine, and cotangent is 1 over tangent. These are our basic trig definitions:
	- By making substitutions to these basic definitions and rearranging, we come up with the alternate forms of our definitions. We have our sine equal to 1 over cosecant. Cosine is equal to 1 over secant. And tangent is equal to 1 over cotangent. What we've done here is simply reverse our beginning definitions for cosecant, secant, and cotangent:

	- One other alternate form is that for the cotangent. Because it is the reciprocal of the tangent, we can also define it as the reciprocal of the tangent definition, or cosine divided by sine.
