Title of Case: Hammer v. Dagenhart
Citation: 247 U.S. 251 (1918)
Facts:

    - The federal government passed a law, called the "Keating-OwenChild Labor Act", which prohibited the interstate shipment of goods manufactured by children under 14, and those children aged 14-16 working more than 8 hours a day.
    - Roland Dagenhart, a father of two children employed in a cotton mill in North Carolina, sued, arguing that the law exceeded Congress' Constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce.

Constitutional Question(s):

    - Did Congress have the authority to regulate child labor within states even though the product goods were shipped out of state?

Holding:

    - No, 5-4

Reasoning - Rule/Test/Principle:

    - The in-state manufacturing of goods is not interstate commerce in itself, the eventual movement of those goods are not causally connected to the manufacturing process.
    - The power to regulate inter-state commerce does not recognize a greater authority to regulate the totality of commerce, especially considering the 10th Amendment reserves all powers not delegated to the federal government to the states.

Application of Rule:

    - The Court found that the law's real aim was not to regulat interstate commerce but instead to enforce a national standard on child labor.
    - Regulation of manufacturing is a local concern, even when the manufactured goods are shipped out of state.

Concurring Opinion(s): - No concurring opinions, majority opinion written by Justice Day. - "There is no power vested in Congress to require the States to exercise their police power so as to prevent possible unfair competition. Many causes may cooperate to give one State, by reason of local laws or conditions, an economic advantage over others. The Commerce Clause was not intended to give to Congress a general authority to equalize such conditions. "

Dissenting Opinion:

    - Justice Holmes authored the dissent stating that the act did not meddle in a power reserved to the state as regulating interstate commerce is something Congress has authority over, and once the goods are moving across state borders, the full chain of commerce is related to interstate commerce.
