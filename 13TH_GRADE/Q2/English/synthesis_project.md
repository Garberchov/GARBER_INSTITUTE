Personalized Education in a Science-Fiction-Inspired Society
Education has been recognized for millennia as an accelerant of individual excellence. The internal ability to learn and grow is foundational to the development of the individual, and is the stated purpose of the modern educational system: to equip students with the skills and knowledge to become productive members of society. Unfortunately, the current system is not living up to its promise and is instead conforming to the political ends of the state in producing generations of "citizens" by an assembly-line, one-size-fits-all model that is not only ineffective but actively harmful to the development of the student. In envisioning a more exciting future for humanity, we must first envision a more comprehensively personalized future for education to produce individuals who are not only more talented and successful but simultaneously more complete and fulfilled.
While tracing the whole history of the modern education system is far beyond the scope of this forward-looking investigation, the current iteration of the United States state-based education system can be traced back to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush. This legislation was, according to its proponents, a response to the failures of the previous system to adequately prepare students for college and the workforce. This was stated directly in the legislation, "Establishes I-A requirements for: (1) yearly testing and assessments of student performance; (2) State standards for and assessments of Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP); (3) local educational agency (LEA) identification of schools for improvement and corrective actions; (4) reporting to parents and the public on school performance and teacher quality (H.R.1 - 107th Congress)." These stated aims, noble and well-sounding, have created a nearly entirely standardized system that suppresses individuality and the development of the students in the image they desire for themselves. Foundationally, the intent--and reality to a certain extent given current schemes for the curriculum--in focusing heavily on standardized testing outcomes was to create a system that would be fair and just to all students, and lead to more comprehensive measures to improve overall educational outcomes. While the maintenance of certain standardized tests may be valuable until a certain point where holistic views into the students' capabilities and specific skills are built into the daily curricula, the current system's one-size-fits-all approach has instead degenerated into "teaching for the test" and the development of a generation of students who are not only undereducated but also undereducated in the most important skills: critical thinking and creativity.
Generative AI, in the form of large language models, has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach education by providing a personalized, adaptive learning experience for each student. This potential capability has been recognized by UNESCO, who published a guidance document--with the intended audience being States, so it is to be taken with the caveat that they are a bureaucracy and not the most forward-thinking organization--in which various benefits and potential challenges of using AI in education are discussed. In specific relation to in-classroom augmentation of the teacher, the guidance document states that "For example, EdGPT models targeting curriculum co-design may allow educators and learners to generate appropriate educational materials such as lesson plans, quizzes and interactive activities that closely align with an effective pedagogical approach and specific curricular objectives and levels of challenge for particular learners. Similarly, in the context of a 1:1 language skills coach, a foundation model refined with texts appropriate for a particular language might be used to generate exemplar sentences, paragraphs or conversations for practice (UNESCO, p.16)." Given this low-hanging fruit of teacher augmentation, both for greater teacher productivity and more personalization for the student, the potential of AI in education is clear - even within the current system. Where the truly transformative, science fiction-esque applications of AI are concerned, the potential is even greater. In order to build a future society filled with individuals who are excellent at doing what they love, a radically new conception of education is required - one that embraces the potential of AI to provide a personalized, adaptive learning experience for each student. One similar to that envisioned by Richard F. Weyand in his Empire series.
It is no exaggeration to say that the two main protagonists of the Empire series, Deanna and Robert Dunham, are driven through the plot largely by the education they receive - personalized and adaptive to their specific needs and desires. This is exemplified best by Robert(Bobby)'s first experience with the "new" system, "'What would you like to do?' The computer had always told him what was next, a sometimes dreary succession of tasks to be performed. He soldiered through them to get to more enjoyable things, but this was new ... A set of options appeared before him. Mathematics, Science, History, Literature, Government. He selected History ... 'You're dragging tail a little this morning,' Megan Dunham said with a chuckle when Bobby came into the kitchen for breakfast. 'I stayed up too late studying,' Bobby said. (Weyand, p. 39-41)." This is the kind of education that is possible when the student is given the agency to choose their own direction, and given responsibility for their own learning outcomes. This is the kind of educational experience that AI could provide to every student given the operational freedom to do so. This potential is beginning to be more widely recognized, with the University of Iowa in their paper on The role of AI in modern education stating, "AI in education facilitates individualized learning by tailoring instructional content to individual student needs, benefiting students, teachers, and resource-constrained schools. This approach allows students to progress at their own pace, engage with activities aligned with their learning styles, and gain more autonomy over their educational journeys (College of Education, University of Iowa, 2024)." That even traditionally conservative and risk-averse institutions like Universities and UNESCO are beginning to recognize the potential of AI-enhanced education as seen directly in science fiction is indicative of the potential of AI to fundamentally transform how education is delivered to students.
Given the political gridlock, risk-aversion, and general inertia of the current educational system, it is very unlikely in my view that the State's education system will be the one that will implement this science fiction-esque educational experience. Instead, it is likely that the private sector will be the one to lead the way, with companies like Synthesis School and Heretic.School building and selling AI-personalized education directly to families. Synthesis School was founded by John Dahn who previously ran Ad Astra for the kids of SpaceX employees at the direct request of Elon Musk, and Heretic.School is a company I myself started to build hyper-personalized education within the legal framework of homeschooling. Heretic.School exists as part of the greater "educational accelerationism" movement, spearheaded by the use of AI to provide a tech-enabled, personalized education to students. I described the role of AI in this movement in some of my own work, "The democratization of artificial intelligence is the key technological enabler of edu/acc. As the cost of AI continues to plummet and capabilities increase exponentially, we can finally break free from the economic constraints that have historically limited personalized education to the elite. Low-cost AI tutors, adaptive learning systems, and automated content recommendation make it possible to provide great-mind quality education at scale (Garber, 2025)" This critical technological advancement, intelligence out of a pipe, allows for the democratization of education, and the ability to provide high-quality, personalized education that would have required one-to-one tutoring at a cost less than a coffee per day.
With the current and future systems of education examined, seeing what a future society with the full potential of AI-enhanced education looks like becomes a far clearer image. I think Bobby and Deanna's experience in Empire, driving themselves out of grinding, backwoods poverty to become the most powerful people in the galaxy, is a fairly realistic depiction of what a future society with the full potential of AI-enhanced education looks like. The early recognition of interests and talents, specific resources and opportunities to apply them in real-world contexts, and a high-agency-default system that allows for the development of the student in the image they desire for themselves. At a deep level, this connects to full recognition of the individual rights that John Locke established in his conception of Liberty, where each person has the natural right to determine their own path and development without undue constraint. The current one-size-fits-all educational model violates-- in spirit, if not in law--this Lockean principle by forcing students into standardized molds that degrade their individuality and systemically reduce their long-term potential in the de-facto acceptance of a socially and structurally conformist system. This effectively denies them the liberty to pursue their own intellectual flourishing in accordance with their natural abilities and interests, in a way that would produce a far more productive, creative, and interesting world. This alignment of economic interests (as everyone would be far wealthier if able to pursue their most attuned career path), political implications (creating far more informed and engaged citizens), and ethical considerations (ending a system that limits and punishes individuality) presents a high and noble purpose for the development of AI-enhanced education.
In conclusion, the current system of education is not only not living up to its promise, but is actively harmful to the development of the student as an individual. AI, a fundamental step-change in technology, has the potential to provide a personalized, adaptive learning experience for each student, allowing them to pursue their own intellectual flourishing in accordance with their own individual interests, abilities, and views of their own future. This is a vision of a science fiction future, one not of dystopia but of an optimistic, realistic, and hopeful future based on the recognition of the individual rights of each person to determine their own path, development, and agency on their path to their own flourishing.
