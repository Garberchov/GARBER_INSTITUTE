- p52: the claim that invention/innovation/discovery is not a one-time lightbulb moment but instead an "extended episode with a highly recurrent structure" is, upon reflection, incredibly persuasive. Even the most generalized "lightbulb moment" does not solve the problem or see the whole solution but instead gives you the first toe-hold to the solution.
- p59: The story about how x-rays were discovered, using cathode ray tubes, actually further proves the point because this is the same technology that would be the upstream precursor of a number of later technologies, including the cathode ray tube television.
- p60: "Paradigm procedures and applications are as necessary to science as paradigm laws and theories" feels very similar in spirit to the "amateurs study tactics, professionals study logistics" quote.
- p62: The key point of the entire chapter is not that the scientific method is a hoax, but that the existence of the scientific method is not to prove existing theories but to find places for anomolies to slot where they shouldn't, and then a method to test these anomalies. 
- p64: "That awareness of of anomaly opens a period in which conceptual categories are adjusted until the initally anomalous has become the anticipated". I wonder if some people are naturally more prone to accepting the incorrect stauts quo than others as a function of their psychology, and if by the same turn if there are people who are naturally better at finding anomalies than others.
