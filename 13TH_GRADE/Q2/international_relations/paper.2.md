Throughout history new technologies have been used to enhance the lethality and range of warfare. A new era of cyber warfare, emerging as a key weakness in the last two decades, has created a new domain of conflict that not only affects the forces on the frontline but can be used to cripple an entire nation the second a war breaks out. The United States developed the internet and continues to lead the world in technological innovation yet that is no longer enough to protect the country from cyber threats: cyber warfare is a domain that is heavily trafficked in by adversaries of the United States and its interests, and a new doctrine must be constructed to make the United States not just competitive but dominant in the cyber domain as it is in any other domain of warfare. Just like in any other domain of warfare, a multi-faceted approach must be taken to ensure the United States is protected from cyber threats, beginning first with a clear and concise diplomatic policy that clearly states the United States's position on cyber warfare and the actions it will take in the event of an attack, followed by a robust cyber defense strategy that includes generalized capabilities, and finally an industrial policy that ensures that the United States is not buying critical infrastructure from foreign adversaries.

Fundamentally, as Alperovitch argues in his article for _Foreign Affairs_, just because the visiblity of cyber warfare is so much less than that of traditional warfare, it still conforms to the same principles of war and politics. A cyber attack is deterred by the same principles of deterrence as a conventional attack, even if the principles of active defense are very different. He cites the example of the agreement between President Obama and Xi Jinping to stop cyber espionage by the state against private companies, "Initially, the agreement was a limited success. Intrusions from Chinese government-affiliated groups dropped to their lowest level in over a decade in 2016. And for the next two years, American companies enjoyed a brief respite from what had previously been an unrelenting assault by Chinese military-and intelligence-affiliated hackers (Alperovitch, p. 45)." This is the kind of direct engagement between actors in the diplomatic realm that is necessary to deter or limit the damage of cyber warfare by clearly stating the reaction a state will take in the event of an attack - the general policy previously of varying degrees of retaliation or condemnation was not effective because no actor has sufficient credibility that they would take the same response twice. As Alperovitch argues, "The United States has also sought to deter adversaries by threatening to take the offensive and carry out retaliatory cyberattacks. Yet despite all these steps, neither North Korea nor Russia—nor any other U.S. adversary, for that matter—has ceased targeting the United States. That is because vulnerability to cyber-attacks is not a technical problem that hardened defenses or narrow, cyber-focused deterrence can fix. Cyberattacks are a symptom, not a disease; the underlying conditions are broader geopolitical problems that demand geopolitical solutions—namely high-level negotiations with adversaries in the pursuit of agreements that all parties can live with (Alperovitch, p. 46)."

Part of the problem in any conflict in the cyber domain is that it is never a fair fight, as Alperovitch says clearly, "Attackers have an inherent advantage in cyberspace: when the cost on each attempted hack is low and the penalties are effectively nonexistent ... That asymmetric advantage makes aggressors quite likely to succeed eventually, since they need to get lucky only once, whereas defenders must discover and stop each hacking attempt (Alperovitch, p. 47)." This inherent offensive advantage is why a generalized policy of not only defensive cyber warfare but the maintenace and furthering of offensive cyber warfare capabilities is necessary to ensure the United States is protected from cyber threats. This was not something well done by the Obama administration in the initial establishemnt of U.S. Cyber Command as Gordon and Rosenbach argue, but something that the Trump administration improved upon significantly(if not totally), "National Security Adviser John Bolton announced a more aggressive approach to offensive cyber-operations, permitting the military to conduct operations below the legal threshold of an "armed attack" with the approval of the Secretary of Defense, as outlined in National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, which enabled cyber-operations like denial-of-service attacks and information operations, demonstrating the effectiveness of low-level, proactive cyber-tactics and the idea that deterrence in cyberspace can be achieved through low-tech, low-risk, targeted operations (Gordon and Rosenbach, p. 16)." While the exact details of what make up a robust cyber warfare capability are considerably more opaque than that of a conventional military force, as you can see tanks and artillery pieces but not scripts and malware, but can only be measured imprecisely by the relative prevelance of cyber attacks occuring. More than this, defensive measures to increase the relative difficulty of attacking more critical pieces of cyber infrastructure can and should be taken, as well as a straegic change in the nature of Cyber Command, "Biden could shape Cyber Command into something more akin to today's nimble, flexible Joint Special Operations Command and less like the lumbing Strategic Air Command of the 1950s (Gordon and Rosenbach, p. 19)." This comparison is particularly apt, as at the time Strategic Air Command was the offensive agent for the use of nuclear weapons and thus had an extremely high required level of certainty for any authorization of force. When compared to Joint Special Operations Comamnd(JSOC), where operators frequently make small interventions in response to threats to U.S. interests without full engagement in a war against a nation, that is a far more well deserving philosophy for operations in Cyber Command.

Finally, the United States industrial base must refocus itself on the production of technologies domestically(or with allies) to ensure that the United States is not reliant on foreign adversaries for critical infrastructure. The example of the Chinese port cranes is particularly acute, though this is the same for electrical transformers and other pieces of critical infrastructure technology. Port cranes to lift containers are mundane in the general course of business, but when they are highly automated as they are today--rightfully so given the significant productivity gains--the ability for a foreign adversary to effectively scuttle them through outside control and thus cripple military and civilian supply chains is a very real threat. This is not a remote treat, and is an obvious vector of attack when hte vast majority of port cranes are bought from China, an obvious strategic adversary, "the joint congressional investigation uncovered unauthorized cellular modems hidden on some ZPMC cranes that could bypass port firewalls (CBS News)." This is emblematic of a broader trend of the United States's reliance on foreign adversaries, particularly China, for critical infrastructure, and rebuilding a domestic or allied industrial base to produce these is a simple necessity in order to not lose a war before it is fought through cyber control of critical infrastructure.
