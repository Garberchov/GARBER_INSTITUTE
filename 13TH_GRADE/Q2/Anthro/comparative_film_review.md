### Comparative Film Review of _Resistance is Life_ and _Last Man in Aleppo_

```
This course focuses heavily on the importance of witnessing and recording with respect to humanitarianism. In the first C&I on human rights, we discussed the importance of photography and media, and here too, we look at the importance of media but focus on film, journalism, and other forms of audio-visual records of humanitarian crisis, violence, and conflict. Based on our first quarter survey and the timeliness of the contemporary global context, we will be watching two films that focus on the humanitarian crisis in Syria. The films, Last Men in Aleppo and Resistance in Life, will be watched in class, and after each film, we will hold a brief group discussion about them.



Both films are about the Syrian humanitarian crisis and were released in the same year (2017). The idea is that you will get to see two films approach the humanitarian crisis from different perspectives. You will construct and write a comparative film review that brings both films together.



Your review is due anytime between Wednesday and Sunday of Week 5. You are encouraged to plan in advance to carve out time to take notes about each film, outline, and write your review during Weeks 2-4. Examples and a rubric for the review will be discussed during Week 2 and can also be found on Camino under Assignments. The review is worth 100 points and the rubric for this assignment is as follows:



45 points: providing accurate summary of film, characters, background, historical and filming context, and what you see as the filmâ€™s main purpose



45 points: providing specific details and evidence supporting your critical analyses and arguments including quotes, scenic descriptions, excerpts and facts



10 points: at least 2-3 pages of writing (double-spaced); constructed in the 2nd and 3rd person point of view, has accessible and clear language, appeals to audiences, includes a conclusion that brings home your assessment of the film and arguments, is free of spelling and grammatical errors, and is submitted on time

The Civil War in Syria raged for over a decade, and the devastation wrought by the conflict will be felt for generations to come. The brutal conflict between the Syrian government and a myriad of rebel groups from Kurds to ISIS has left a scar on the landscape and people of Syria. The two films _Resistance is Life_ and _Last Man in Aleppo_ are both fundamnetally centered around the conflict but take it from very different perspecties - _Last Man in Aleppo_ is an up-close look at the White Helmets, a group of volunteer first responders, focusing primarily on Khaled who was a leader in the organization, who risked their lives to rescue those caught in Russian and Syrian government bombing raids on the rebel-held part of Aleppo, while _Resistance is Life_ chronicles a family, focusing on the experiences of the daughter, Evlin, and their life in a refugee camp in Turkey just over the border from the embattled Kuridsh city holdout of Kobane. The depiction of the Syrian Civil War across these two films is fundamentally different, but both shine a powerful light on the human cost of the conflict.

Without a doubt, _Last Man in Aleppo_ is the more gruesome of the two films - very little of the actual figting or aftermath is shown in _Resistance is Life_, but the violence and destruction shown in _Last Man in Aleppo_ is harrowing and difficult to watch even for viewers who have viewed material from other conflicts before. The images of the devastation wrought by the Russian Air Force, in support of the Syrian government, in indiscrimate bombing raids on the civilian population using barrel bombs and incendiary weapons illustrate the true brutality of the Syrian Civil War. I think the images of Khaled and the White Helmets risking their lives to rescue civilians from the rubble of their homes is even more powerful - the view of the volunteers working deep into the night with an excavator to move tons of rubble off the trapped family while cars "cook off" and explode around them is a true testament to the courage and dedication of the White Helmets even surrounded by such bleak circumstances. While not quite as dramatic, the image of the children and parents taking time during the tmeporary ceasefire to go to the playground and being interrupted by the resuming of bombing raids is perhaps even more heart-wrenching - the juxtaposition of the play being cut short so that the "war times" can resume is one of the most powerful images in the film.

_Resistance is Life_, partially by its nature as focused largely on the daily life of a child, but also due to the differing geographical location of the film, is more intimate and personal comparatively. The film is about Evlin and her family in the Turkish refugee camp just over the border from Kobane, and while a limited view of the fighting in Kobane is shown after the Kurds won the battle against ISIS, the film is primarily focused on life in the refugee camp. This was _aggressively_ illustrated by the play the children put on as part of their schooling in the refugee camp, where they portrayed the life of a Kurdish fighter being killed in combat, chanting about how "Martyrs never die": this coming from 8-10 year old children was the most viscerally impactful moment of the film. If a viewer didn't know more about the conflict and history of the Kuridsh poeple, they would be forgiven for believing that it was a form of propaganda. The individul and collective resilience of the Kurdish people is truly remarkable, as is illustrated by when a huge portion of the refugee camp takes to the plain across the border from Kobane, where shots can be heard of the fighting in Kobane, and they begin chanting as a show of support for the fighters holding the line, and eventually reversing the tide of the battle against ISIS.

In the end, both films shine powerful light on the human cost of the Syrian Civil War, from the perspective of both displaced civilians and the first responders who risked their lives to save their fellow citizens while at the mercy of horrendous circumstances. Between the two, I think _Last Man in Aleppo_ better illustrates the sheer brutality of the conflict, but _Resistance is Life_ is the more powerful reminder of the positive power of human resilience: the Kurds won the battle for Kobane and people began flowing back to their city, no matter how ruined. It has been 7 years since those films were made and the Syrian Civil War has ended but the deep scars of the war across the people and landscape have gouged themselves inexorably into the fabric of Syrian society.
