Final Exam: Ethics and Politics (PHIL 28) – Winter 2025

The exam consists of one big question about citizenship which I have divided into several parts.  You need to respond to three of the sub-questions in answering the larger question; I’ll weigh the separate parts equally in the grade. Your answer should be double-spaced in a 12-point font with normal margins. The best answers will (a) make effective use of the texts we have discussed in class this quarter – you should aim to talk in a substantial way about at least two of our authors per subsection – and (b) demonstrate awareness of the presence of, and understanding of the grounds for, competing points of view. Your entire exam should not exceed 10 pages maximum. There is no minimum. I do not grade by quantity; the page limit is intended to protect me from over-long exams, not to force you to write the maximum. I’m sure there will be A exams that have less than 10 pages (and exams of ten pages that aren’t A’s!)

One piece of advice: The questions are framed pretty abstractly. You will likely write better replies if you try to discuss the questions via concrete examples that illustrate the issues Involved.

I of course expect that your work will be entirely your own. You may speak with other students in the class about the questions, but you should not share any writing with each other. You should not even discuss the questions with people from outside the class – family, other professors, outside students, etc.

The exam is due as a digital submission on Camino (a pdf or doc)  by 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, March 19.

The Big Question: What characterizes good citizenship in a liberal democratic society such as ours?

Write your response to THREE  of the following four sub-questions:

- How much and what kind of civic participation ought to be expected of a citizen? (Possible examples: paying taxes, voting, staying informed, military or other service, political activism.)
	- Quote Aristotle and argue against him that the private sphere is where the best citizens spend most of their time, quote Constant's Liberty of the Ancients vs Moderns and agree with him on modern.

- Do citizens have any specifically cultural obligations to the society they live in?
	- Say no, quote Massey in the Real Hispanic Challenge to oppose quotes from Huntington.
- What emotions ought good citizens to feel for their state? Responsibility for the state’s actions? Gratitude? Devotion? Love? Should the good citizen feel differently about her fellow citizens than she does about outsiders?
	- Quote Tamir and disagree with the uniqueness of nationality, propose national fealty to principles(Liberal ones), flow to Appiah in Cosmopolitan Patriots and agree but say he doesn't take it far enough, that a genuinely world nation is better and that we should feel no emotions towards our state on principle save for those we feel towards the PRINCIPLES of our state.
