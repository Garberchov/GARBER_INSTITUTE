Select and answer one of the following questions, drawing on the Federalist Papers, Anti-Federalist writings, and contemporary examples to support your argument:

To what extent has the US Constitution led to the consolidation of power at the national level, and what implications does this have for state sovereignty?

In your response, cite and analyze at least three passages or quotes from the Federalist or Anti-Federalist texts, using the following template:

"In Federalist/Anti-Federalist paper, X argues that_______________. More specifically, X argues that _______________. She/he writes, “_______________.” In this passage, X is suggesting that _______________. In conclusion, X’s belief is that _______________."

Additionally, cite and analyze one to three contemporary examples that support your argument. Justify your contemporary examples by demonstrating how they align with the Federalist or Anti-Federalist position.

Your essay should not exceed 1,200 words in length.

The question of the balance of power between the sovereignty of the State Governments versus the Supreme power of the National Government has been an institutional part of American political discourse since the founding of the nation. The sphere of influence of the Federal Government, even while growing more strictly delineated from the State Governments, has grown far beyond the original grounding of the Constitution, dealing itself continually more power by fiat at the expense of the States and their citizens. While most of the proposed solutions of the Anti-Federalists have not been borne out by history, the methadological concerns they raised with the construction and nature of the Constitution certainly have been.

Brutus 1 mentions this specifically in reference to the Necessary and Proper Clause, a function of the Constitution that expressly allows Congress to give itself powers not explicitly stated in the Constitution necessary for it to execute those enumerated powers, saying "This government is to possess absolute and uncontrollable power, legislative, executive and judicial, with respect to every object to which it extends". This was seen by Brutus to be a clear and present danger to the expressed individual autonomy of the States, and the liberties of their people, and with the range of powers, duties, and responsibilites that the Federal Government has given itself without Constituional amendmnet, it is hard to discharge Brutus's concerns. This is very clearly seen today with education policy, as this is a common friction point between the Federal Government and the States - States nominally control their own education policy, but the Federal Government--having decided that it is necessary for the Federal Government to have a stance on education policy--has been able to substnatively effect nation wide education policy through the use of Federal funding, funding which comes from taxes levied on the citizens of the States.

Brutus 1 also raises the danger of the Supremacy clause, which gives the Federal Government judicial priority in the interpretation of its laws in comparison to those of the States. In the words of Brutus, "It appears from these articles that there is no need of any intervention of the state governments, between the Congress and the people, to execute any one power vested in the general government, and that the constitution and laws of every state are nullified and declared void ...all that is reserved for the individual states must very soon be annihilated, except so far as they are barely necessary to the organization of the general government". This, in combination with the Necessary and Proper Clause which exapnds the range of areas the Federal Government can allow itself to exercise power, gives the Federal Government such a totality of potential power that it is able to effect its will--the will of the people, yes, but indirectly, through the distorted mechanisms of the Constitution and the courts, a process opaque and catering to a great many special interests.

Brutus 11 expands on this point of the Federal Government's lack of direct connection to the specific interests of the people, specifically in the case of the Judiciary. The Federal Government, with the Supreme Court and the appointed Appelate courts, is able to make decisions that affect the nature of government without any direct connection to the specific interests of its people, instead being a one-level of separation arm of the political whims of the day. Brutus makes this clear when he says, "That the judicial power of the United States, will lean strongly in favour of the general government, and will give such an explanation to the constitution, as will favour an extension of its jurisdiction, is very evident from a variety of considerations" - more specifically, when he talks about the nature of how the Constitution is specifically vague to allow the courts to interpret the Constitution in an expansionary manner, the parallels to todays sprawling administrative state are clear.

The consequences of this federal power are clear in todays political landscape. The Federal Government has grown to such a size, at the expense of the States and their citizens being allowed to have their specific wishes and interests be represented, that the Federal Government is fundamentally diminishing the ability of citizens to be represented by their elected officials. While not specifically in reference to Brutus, an old joke from Milton Friedman sums up the situation well: "There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government program" - governments of increasing size grow more quickly, and look to increase their own power and size, the construction of the United States Federal Government is no different.
