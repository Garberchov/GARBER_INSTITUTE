##### Chapter 1:

I had a headache, and Captain Dan Abel wasn't making it any easier on me = the man just would not shut the fuck up. While he was nominally my superior, every other of his chummy Captain friends was treated like a partner who had ideas worth listening to, but as the most junior captain I was treated like 9 year old who could be treated like gum on the bottom of his boot. 

"Captain Poten, are you still with us?" Captain Abel asked me, I obviously wasn't and I was the only other person in the room with him, so it just added to his piece of shit persona; I shook my head to say yes so that he would leave me alone and go back to his speaking so I could ignore him. Everything he was slowly and derrogatoril.y explaining to me I had learnt at the academy already ,and done many times as a second and then first officer. No, I had never done it as a Captain but I had shadowed mine as he went through the steps any number of times. Trust your crew, be decisive, and keep the passengers informed. Obviously the indiviudal steps of Captaining a colony trasport ship from the Terra Major station, to the warp gate and down to the surface of a colony were far more complex but those basic rules and a modicum of qualified officer material ensured safety and prosperity in all but the most extreme circumstances.
