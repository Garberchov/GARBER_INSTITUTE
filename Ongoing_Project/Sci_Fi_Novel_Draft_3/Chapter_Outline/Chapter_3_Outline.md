Chapter 3: Mutiny
        Basic Goals:
                - Show Leon's resolve, despite his lack of confidence in his own abilities in how he talks down the mutiny
        Basic Plot Points:
               - After announcing that there is a moon that is habitable for them in their new solar system, the monitors on the bridge show several lower ranked crew members in charge of monitoring the passengers whipping them into mutiny saying that Leon had deliberately taken them away to be sold as slaves.
                - Two crew members and three passengers who object are brutalized, and are severely injured and knocked unconscious - one negotiator for the mutineers, named Edwin Shockley is allowed to come and negotiate for the mutineers - asking for control of the ship and the imprisonment of the bridge staff, despite the fact that they have no leverage to demand that besides the health and well being of the injured and reluctant civilians and crew who only decided to join to not be injured.
