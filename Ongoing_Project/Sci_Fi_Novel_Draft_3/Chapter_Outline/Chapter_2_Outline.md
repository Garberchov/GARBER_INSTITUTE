Chapter 2: Arrival, or lack thereof
        Basic Goals:
                - Introduce characters
                - Adequately show the sense of terror, resignation and confusion that being thrown into a completely random star system would have on the crew and Leon.
        Basic Plot Points:
                - The aftermath of the "oh shit moment" as the crew on the bridge rapidly come to the conclusion that they have been thrown into the middle of nowhere, 4000 light years from earth and without hope of returning as they don't have a wormhole gate generator.
                - Alexander Cando confirming through his place at the sensor station that they are 4000 light years away, and calling the heads of the departments to the bridge.
                - Leon addressing the crew, similar to Roosevelt leading the U.S through the great depression
                - Leon announcing that the whole crew is summarily conscripted in their struggle to survive, he gives them one hour to cry or scream but no violence will be permitted - they will make it through.
                - At the end of the hour, and with further work from the bridge crew they announce to everyone aboard - both the 28000 passengers and 1200 crew that they have located a moon on the fourth planet of the second star that is seemingly habitable, and that they will be approaching it - all suggestions for the new government that will be formed to ensure their survival are welcomed.
