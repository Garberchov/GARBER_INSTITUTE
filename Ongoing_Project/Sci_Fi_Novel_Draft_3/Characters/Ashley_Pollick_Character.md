#### Character: Ashley Pollick

Ashley Pollick, Chief Engineer on *Matador*, Leon Poten's long time girlfriend and his dynamic duo, just as nerdy as Leon but generally more confident. Dating since they were both 17 and attended the academy together, being placed on ships together all through Leon's rise as an officer and her corresponding rise as an engineer to chief engineer on *Matador*, their relationship is not exactly a secret - espically to many of the more senior officers on *Matador*, but it is not public knowledge. Heavily sarcastic, brusque and self assured she is a leader to many of the young talents across the ship.
