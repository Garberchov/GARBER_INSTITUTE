Weds/Thurs - develop topic for research paper on the idea of ENVIRONMENT / POLLUTION ... keep in mind: we are talking about CHEMISTRY  here - not pontificating on the  moral issues therein.  Research paper topic presentation should have TOPIC, *EARLY* THESIS OR PROBLEM TO INVESTIGATE, LIST OF 4 PRELIMINARY SOURCES TO USE FOR RESEARCH.  Thesis should be well formulated to succinctly describe something you are going to EXPLAIN about (this is a RESEARCH/INVESTIGATION) and provide some conclusions as relates to the interaction of your topic and the broader world / society / business / health etc. 
This is a starting point but should have some clues as to the meat you are going to dive into.

History:  we will review the revisions to the Lincoln's shortcomings / failings essay. 
Start a "Civil War" unit ending essay - more formal essay style - on the INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS / EFFECTS OF THE US. CIVIL WAR.  Four differentiated upstanding sources minimum. Intro - three + body paragraphs of support - conclusion. 
Don't bite off more than is chewable in this format -- i.e. talk about France - not all of Europe lumped together - as needed.  Or about the diplomatic core - drill down to a notable envoy maybe? Show some real depth of study / research 
Make sure to FIND A THESIS ... Internationally, was the Civil War important b/c it disrupted trade? Because it created unbalance in economics? Because it made moral wars too easy to break out in other countries? Don't be too general & don't be afraid to really dig into the research.
