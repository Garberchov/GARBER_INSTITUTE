 -- > Go back into the Lincoln's weaknesses summary session.  Your broad points are valid but it needs some more heft of research in the written process.  Go to Ken Burns Civil War series and watching ONE on Lincoln or the end of the war era. 
While writing straightforward history summaries, remember that you aren't in a SPEECH mode (you aren't "speaking" or "convincing" anyone). You are delivering factual, compelling evidence in an organized fashion. 
"Civil War" is capitalized, as is "from the North" (but not "moved north to escape slavery.") 

--> Math: move thru toward a quiz date for Mon or Tues - you tell me when ready. 
--> Science: if site working, go ahead with quiz today. 
--> Comp Sci & Italian - spend your "period" on the next topic. 
--> Prep period (next few i'd think):  Investigate different 11th grade "psychics" classes available on different platforms (power homeschool, Acellus, etc. - different venues both "canned" and maybe interactive.)  Investigate AP classes for next year -- how to get cirriculum, see classes, take tests. Different subject areas.  Spitball on Prussia book -- four different ways we might "use" it in cirriculum -- i.e. leaders, comparisons, dissolution etc. Some specific theses.  Reach out to Santa Clara re: virtual tours; requirements from homeschool students; preference ACT/SAT etc.
