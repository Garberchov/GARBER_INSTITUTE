Math:  Continue on subunit 8.3; prepare for quiz WEDS. 

Science:  Working on research project. 
This week, please provide: 

Detailed list of sources identified in relative MLA format (give me some reference as to length, date published, journal it may be in etc.) - with each source, provide a snapshot 1-2 sentences about what type of information you are utilizing from the source.  I.E. "background on the chemistry involved"  "real world examples of problems / uses for product" 

Reminder that this is a RESEARCH PROJECT that serves to EXPLAIN the item to the reader, NOT ADVOCATE for it.  You can AND SHOULD  have a scientific conclusion that you have laid out and frame the paper around - but this should be (relatively) unbiased PROS and CONS.  We want to UNDERSTAND your CONCLUSIONS, not be SWAYED by your OPINIONS.  

Toward this end, please create a detailed OUTLINE of the proposed research paper this week -- this is a large undertaking and don't want it to lose its impact for lack of forethought in the organization. It's OK if not all areas are fully fleshed out (ie you may realize you need more research on the US vs EUROPEAN uses for the product...) but provide the scaffolding and some of the meat you will use to support it.   Let me know if you need more description of the kind of info I'd like to see here. 

Computer Science:  Continue on Code Academy (remembering to save unit completion pages) 
Begin the design for a PROJECT ... provide a tear sheet this week that oulines:  GOAL, RESOURCES, PLAN.  Be sure to continue to update the tear sheet as items get more detail (as you complete them) and/or change directions / tactics.  Please date the entries. 

Italian:  Continue with Rosetta stone - saving unit completions. 

ELA: 
Creative Writing:  Continue writing. Do a pointed/intentional review of the earlier chapters written with the elements of prose (one at a time) in mind: IE. Characterization. Take on the lead character:  what have you revealed about him.  Is he fully dimensional? Flaws / fatal flaws revealed or is he "heroic"? MARK THE PLACES IN THE TEXT WITH TEXT NOTES WHERE YOU IDENTIFY THESE THINGs.  Same for SETTING. LANGUAGE. TONE. THEME. 

Llterature:  Beginning Group Read.  HOLD OFF FOR A DAY - I MAY WANT TO REVISIT TITLE. Begin reading A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT.  

HISTORY: 
Westward Expansion Unit - Leading into Industrialization/Robber Barons/T.R. / SpanAmerican War

Summary Sessions: 
Same format. PLEASE pay some attention to grammar (commas, run-ons, capitalization--"the West was settled" vs. "the move west was driven by...") and to be targeted in your points. "A leads to B, that's why we see C". 

--> Broad motivation:  four primary reasons that the country/populace pushed west. Don't give me just a headline though - ..yes the railroads but WHAT ABOUT THEM WAS IMPT TO THIS MOVEMENT.

--> Technology.  Four new technologies / inventions that facilitated (or hampered???) movement westward. What were they, why were they important (what did they facilitate/improve/revolutionize), did they remain relevant? 

 --> The government:  Discuss three to four main acts/actions by the government that played pivotal role in move westward.  Part of the discussion: were POLITICIANS important in this time, which ones & why? 

--> The impact of Westward expansion on Native American tribes. (A little more depth): 
What were the issues the Native Americans faced with respect to Westward Expansion?
What were the DIFFERING opinions among politicians (and those in their orbit) about the Native American population and handling their settlements? 
Review / synthesize the following items / events: 

Sand Creek Massacre
Fort Laramie Treaty
reservation system
General Custer and the Battle of Little Bighorn
Dawes Act
