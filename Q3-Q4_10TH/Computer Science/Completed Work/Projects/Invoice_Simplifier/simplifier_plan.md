Goal:
        Provide a much simplified entry process for catering invoice information with tabulation for master lists and pre formatted invoices with auto tallying(much like an excel sheet). 
Problem:
        Too much time is spent manual entering data and formatting it with prices and other information like special requests etc. 
Design Plan:
        Tkinter GUI [Customer Name, Item, Size if Applicable, Date of Pickup]-> Full database with all data for both days -> Invoice -->> Master Sheet sorted by day
