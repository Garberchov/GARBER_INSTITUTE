International Reaction To The Civil War

As much as the American Civil War is portrayed as a conflict between brothers, the impact that the war had was not limited to American shores. The reality was the quite the opposite as the economic and political reverberations of the conflict spread across the globe and most notably to Europe. As hard as the quartermasters, generals and tacticians worked in the first months and years of the conflict before the rhythms of the conflict were set in stone it is not well known that they overshadowed the diplomats who held far greater power over the conflict in their hands than they would ever know. There are a multitude of reasons that foreign powers did not join in arms either the union or confederacy but throughout the war this was not a forgone conclusion, and at points it seemed likely that either power would gain foreign assistance in their war efforts. The most impactful of these reasons in the political realm was the spectre of slavery in the Confederate's Casus Belli and the Union's inability to forcefully denounce it in the early days of the conflict. The monarchies of Europe were also concerned about setting the precedent of secession, as the spectre of popular revolution was always hanging over the heads of the kings and queens of Europe. In the economic domain, the most significant concern was the union blockade that held highly valued cotton from leaving southern ports to their peacetime destinations in the harbors of Amsterdam, Brest and London along with the material supremacy of Northern industrial outfits.

While the cruelties that the monarchies of Europe inflicted upon their subject nations should not be understated, both Britain and France banned slavery across their respective empires in 1833 and 1844 respectively, leading to concerns of political and social unease if they were to so publicly and militarily endorse a nation wholly reliant on slavery. Southern diplomats and politicians also could not ease this fear as if they publicly renounced their nation's love affair with slave labor, they risked losing support among their own rich plantation owners who funded great parts of the war in large part due to their guarantees that slavery would remain. If the Union had taken a more vocal early stand against slavery then they could have much more easily swayed either of these major powers to their side, if not just maintaining their perch of neutrality. Slavery on European soil was almost universally despised among the monarchies of Europe, however it was still a contentious issue among those who espoused a view of European superiority as to the merit of enslavement in the colonies of each respective empire. Turmoil as to whether or not the native populations that had been federated into the empires of Europe should be enslaved was widespread and if the government of each nation could be seen taking a stand on the issue it could provoke the other great power of Europe leading to the American Civil War spiralling into an inter-continental conflict.

The precedent of secession was also a spectre that weighed heavily on the minds of the two great monarchies of Europe. If they were to side with the confederacy and support their legal right to secede from the United States, a nation they were nominally friendly with then any of the territories they had conquered could do the same thing under the same pretext. Visions of every nation conquered across South America, Africa and Asia revolting within only a few years of the endorsement of the confederate precedent flashing in the minds of the leaders of France and Britain and they were not fond of the image. At the time of the American Civil War, France and Britain were the two greatest powers of the world followed far behind in their wake by Spain, Prussia and the United States. France and Britain controlled so much territory across the globe that the garrison forces they left behind to hold the territory were meager, and the thought of a semi-coordinated large scale uprising across the breadth and width of their empires was a nightmare scenario for each respective empire and one that would be brought all the closer if they endorsed the confederacy.

The cotton factor and later the lack thereof, for nations of Europe the most significant of which were France, Britain and the Dutch Republic was also critical. While the Dutch Republic was not a major military power, either in Europe or across the world they were arguably in the highest echelons of economic might due to their enlightened economic policies and their revolutionary banking and stock exchange institutions. They were a major source of credit for the Union and previously one of the largest importers of cotton from the states that would make up the confederacy. Dutch rivers made them prime candidates for textiles mills, one of the forerunner industries of the Industrial Revolution. Even with their lack of military might, the Dutch still controlled one of the greatest merchant navies of the era and had shipping power that also ranked within the highest echelons of maritime shipping. The significantly greater industry and the naval blockade of the south also meant that siding with the Confederacy in the conflict would have destroyed the incredibly profitable route from the Northern factories to the shores of Europe. The naval blockade of the Confederacy cut off the cotton supply to the Dutch but increased credit opportunities to the union due to increased expenditure from the war, holding the Dutch firmly on the Union's side. 

The French were another matter in the military realm, they came down firmly on the side of army expenditures in the debate between the relevance of a sea or land doctrine and were at the forefront of artillery strategy. France joining in on either side of the conflict would tip the balance of power decidedly, but without cotton imports due to the Union's naval blockade there was no incentive for the French to join the war which would lead to large naval casualties and the expenses of overseas logistics, something the French had already dealt with during their support of the colonies during the American Revolution. Even if the French had dared to brave the overseas logistics and the costs in men and material the conflict would have brought about, the conflict would have been fought on home soil and the Union was becoming a military power in its own right by this time, making it all the more unlikely. This left the French firmly on the side of neutrality, and serving as a mediator and economic beneficiary of the conflict.

Britain's choice to stay neutral in the conflict were largely motivated by the same factors as the Dutch and French, the naval blockade that cut off Confederate cotton, something which the powers detested but were unwilling to risk the costs to break it and the greater economic and military might of the Union compared to the Confederacy. However this did not mean that there was not conflict between the Union and the UK, the Trent affair was one of the most contentious diplomatic and military issues of the war and outraged the british public, politicians, and admiralty to such a degree that some thought that a third war between the UK and USA was inevitable. The Trent affair consisted of two diplomats from the Confederacy slipping through the Union Naval Blockade on a blockade runner, to talk personally with the leaders of France and Britain in order to secure recognition for the Confederacy, the first step to military and economic assistance against the Union. The ship that they were on, the *Trent*, was intercepted by a Union vessel and the British Captain of the vessel stopped in order to save his ship and the two Confederate diplomats were arrested. This was certainly a violation of international law as the Union had no right to stop a ship which was not originating from a nation they were at war with, and British diplomats threatened war and sanctions if reparations were not made. Realizing that they had to normalize relations, after much defusing the two diplomats were released however their mission was not successful as Union military victories and the emancipation proclamation calmed fears of a Confederate victory.

The threat of foreign intervention in the Civil War, while a real possibility throughout the conflict never came to pass and the war between brothers stayed that way, leading to an eventual Union victory through superior military and economic power. The Conflict marked the end of slavery throughout the Union but was only the first nail in the coffin of racial and economic tension throughout the country which has still not been buried today. While the empires that the European powers were so scared of losing were eventually granted independence, it would take another hundred years of oppression and the draining of large parts of their natural resources for them to finally be granted liberty. The Southern States of America still produce cotton as one of their major exports, though sources from Egypt, India and smaller nations throughout Southeast Asia have also become large producers and hydraulic power has now replaced human muscle in the process leading to a more equitable and human rights situation across the world. While the whole impact on the world and individual people might never be collated, the impact on the character of the United States has been codified as part of our civic mentality.
