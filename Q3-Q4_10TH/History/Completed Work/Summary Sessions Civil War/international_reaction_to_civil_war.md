International Reaction To The Civil War

As much as the American Civil War is portrayed as a conflict between brothers the impact that the war had was not limited to American shores, the reality was the quite the opposite as the economic and political reverberations of the conflict spread across the globe and most notably to Europe. As hard as the quartermasters, generals and tacticians worked in the first months and years of the conflict before the rythm of the conflict was set in stone it is not well known that they overshadowed the diplomats who held far greater power over the conflict in their hands than they would ever know. There are a mutlitude of reasons that foreign powers did not join in arms either the union or confederacy but throughout the war this was not a forgone conclusion, and at points it seemed likely that either power would gain foreign assistance in their war efforts. The most impactful of these reasons in the political realm was the spectre of slavery in the Confederate's Casus Belli and the Union's inability to forcefully denounce it in the early days of the conflict. The monarchies of Europe were also concerned about setting the precedent of secession, as the spectre of popular revolution was always hanging over the heads of the kings and queens of Europe. In the economic domain, the most significant concern was the union blockade that held highly valued cotton from leaving southern ports to their peacetime destinations in the harbors of Amsterdam, Brest and London.
