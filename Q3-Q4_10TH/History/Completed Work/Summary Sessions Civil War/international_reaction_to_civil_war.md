International Reaction To The Civil War

As much as the American Civil War is portrayed as a conflict between brothers the impact that the war had was not limited to American shores, the reality was the quite the opposite as the economic and political reverberations of the conflict spread across the globe and most notably to Europe. As hard as the quartermasters, generals and tacticians worked in the first months and years of the conflict before the rhythms of the conflict was set in stone it is not well known that they overshadowed the diplomats who held far greater power over the conflict in their hands than they would ever know. There are a multitude of reasons that foreign powers did not join in arms either the union or confederacy but throughout the war this was not a forgone conclusion, and at points it seemed likely that either power would gain foreign assistance in their war efforts. The most impactful of these reasons in the political realm was the spectre of slavery in the Confederate's Casus Belli and the Union's inability to forcefully denounce it in the early days of the conflict. The monarchies of Europe were also concerned about setting the precedent of secession, as the spectre of popular revolution was always hanging over the heads of the kings and queens of Europe. In the economic domain, the most significant concern was the union blockade that held highly valued cotton from leaving southern ports to their peacetime destinations in the harbors of Amsterdam, Brest and London along with the material supremacy of Northern industrial outfits.

While the cruelties that the monarchies of Europe inflicted upon their subject nations should not be understated, both Britain and France banned slavery across their respective empires in 1833 and 1844 respectively, leading to concerns of political and social unease if they were to so publicly and militarily endorse a nation wholly reliant on slavery. Southern diplomats and politicians also could not ease this fear as if they publicly renounced their nation's love affair with slave labor, they risked losing support among their own rich plantation owners who funded great parts of the war in large part due to their guarantees that slavery would remain. If the Union had taken a more vocal early stand against slavery then they could have much more easily swayed either of these major powers to their side, if not just maintaining their perch of neutrality. Slavery on European soil was almost universally despised among the monarchies of Europe, however it was still a contentious issue among those who espoused a view of European superiority as to the merit of enslavement in the colonies of each respective empire. Turmoil as to whether or not the native populations that had been federated into the empires of Europe should be enslaved was widespread and if the government of each nation could be seen taking a stand on the issue it could provoke the other great power of Europe leading to the American Civil War spiralling into an inter-continental conflict.

The precedent of secession was also a spectre that weighed heavily on the minds of the two great monarchies of Europe. If they were to side with the confederacy and support their legal right to secede from the United States, a nation they were nominally friendly with then any of the territories they had conquered could do the same thing under the same pretext. Visions of every nation conquered across South America, Africa and Asia revolting within only a few years of the endorsement of the confederate precedent flashing in the minds of the leaders of France and Britain and they were not fond of the image. At the time of the American Civil War, France and Britain were the two greatest powers of the world followed far behind in their wake by Spain, Prussia, Poland-Lithuania and the United States. France and Britain controlled so much territory across the globe that the garrison forces they left behind to hold the territory were meager, and the thought of a semi-coordinated large scale uprising across the breadth and width of their empires was a nightmare scenario for each respective empire and one that would be brought all the closer if they endorsed the confederacy.
