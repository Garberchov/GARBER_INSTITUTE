#### What Made The United States The Greatest Economic Power In The World


The U.S is the greatest economic power in the world, and has been for a century and a half - a combination of the economic resources of the territories encompassed, the resourceful nature of its citizens and the ethos of its founders has created the greatest foundation for economic opportunity in human history.  The early 20th century was a seminal time in the history of American economic expansion, as the U.S pulled farther ahead of its competitors in both G.D.P and economic productivity. Technologies integral to productivity and economic output, specifically electricity and the internal combustion engine were more widespread in the U.S than anywhere else in the world. The United States solidified its position of preeminence on the world economic stage in the first decades of the 20th century, with large numbers of the rural poor rapidly joining an emerging urban, manufacturing middle class while advances in technology and business expansion led to more affordable goods. The most important factors in the making of the U.S as the world's greatest economic power was a cultural impetus for innovation, world-leading methods of manufacturing and enormous quantities of natural resources and the means to exploit them.

The American Dream is a nebulous cultural concept that has underpinned American domestic policy from the earliest welfare initiatives to attempts to institute socialized medicine in the modern day, but an overlooked result of this has been an American obsession with technological innovation that has resulted in massive strides socially and economically.
