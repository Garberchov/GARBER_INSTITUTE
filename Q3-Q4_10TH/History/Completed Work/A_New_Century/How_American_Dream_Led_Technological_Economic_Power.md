#### How The American Dream Led To U.S Technological and Economic Power


The American Dream is a nebulous cultural idea that has fostered everything from Westward Expansion to Women's suffrage, but more important and less spoken for is the enormous economic and technological progress it has encouraged - pushing America to the very forefront of the world stage. No time in American history better encapsulates this than the first decades of the 20th century, propelled by progress in areas so central to the modern economic world, The American Dream encouraged American innovators to push the boundaries to ensure a better life for all. Most important in this seminal time for American innovation were new methods of manufacturing that increased employee output and worker conditions, and technological innovations like the automobile and electricity that made daily life easier.

At the time of American independence, the new Untied States was not an industrial power - its economy based largely on agriculture and the export of raw materials. This foundation was useful for the proliferation of industry, but was not a catalyst for it inherently. That catalyst would need to be in the hands of extraordinary individuals, and the first to take up the mantle would be one of the youngest and most forward looking of the nation's founding fathers: Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton believed that America had to challenge Britain and France industrially in order to be a comparably powerful player on the world stage, if the United States just sold them the raw materials to make their manufactured goods they would hold leverage and economic power. His efforts to found one of the first major industrial projects in Northern New Jersey would be one of the first large-scale industrial manifestations of the American Dream, providing thousands of jobs and important job training for a not yet industrialized population. The Trusts of Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan continued this trend of increased industrialization, if uncooperatively, until they were broken up by ROosevelt in his first years as President, which proved to be the final piece to jump-start the wide-scale growth of industry that would dramatically improve the standard of living for all Americans. The distribution of the research adn development organizations from just a few companies holding American industry in an oligopoly to dozens of highly competitive businesses led to a massive proliferation of new goods and products for the American consumer at dramatically lower prices. The possibility of a single machine-shop opening in a town selling a new and innovative product expanding to become a nationwide enterprise proved good motivation for thousands of emerging businesses across the nation, proving an invaluable backbone to the American economy.

The American Dream has been centered around the concept of risk and reward as a fundamental principle, but nowhere is this better seen than in the American adoption of new and emerging technologies. Nowhere in the world had automobilism and electrification been taken with such vigor as the United States, proving a model for industrialized and industrializing nations across the world. While the automobile was not an American invention, contrary to popular belief, the manufacturing framework pioneered by Ford and his chief factory designer, Albert Khan, were the ones to spread it across the world increasing mobility and social equity as a result. The electrification of the nation was also revolutionary, large scale power generation began in the 1880s and by the early 1920s almost every town in America was connected to large scale grids owned by private companies. These dramatically increased living standards, as well as making word dramatically more productive and powering machinery that eliminated repetitive tasks increasing the skill and value of the average worker. No other nation took to such advanced technology so quickly and in such scale as the United States, primarily due to the core tenets of the American Dream where a risk on a technology like this was not only allowed, but encouraged once the benefits were made clear - no sense of tradition was holding people back from improving their lives, when an offer to do it was presented.
