#### How The American Dream Led To U.S Technological and Economic Power


The U.S is the greatest economic power in the world, and has been for a century and a half - a combination of the economic resources of the territories encompassed, the resourceful nature of its citizens and the ethos of its founders has created the greatest foundation for economic opportunity in human history.  The early 20th century was a seminal time in the history of American economic expansion, as the U.S pulled farther ahead of its competitors in both G.D.P and economic productivity. Technologies integral to productivity and economic output, specifically electricity and the internal combustion engine were more widespread in the U.S than anywhere else in the world. The United States solidified its position of preeminence on the world economic stage in the first decades of the 20th century, with large numbers of the rural poor rapidly joining an emerging urban, manufacturing middle class while advances in technology and business expansion led to more affordable goods. The most important factors in the making of the U.S as the world's greatest economic abd technological power was a cultural impetus for innovation, world-leading methods of manufacturing and enormous quantities of natural resources and the means to exploit them.

The American Dream is a nebulous cultural concept that has fostered technological and economic progress in the U.S for two centuries. Manifesting in people across the nation as a willingness to take on risks to improve their own lives, it has also spurred technological innovation to levels unparalleled by any other nation. No other nation took to automobilism or electrification with such vigor as the United States, nor championed the causes of automation and increased worker productivity to such levels - the American dream has helped the nation lead on all of these fronts. This has resulted in a concentration of expertise in these cutting-edge subjects that has entrenched America as the world's leading technological and economic driver for over a century and was wholly unrivaled until the advent of computers - an industry the nation still leads. There is no firm start date for when this concentration of expertise and innovative spirit began, though glimmers of it can be seen in the expansion of the business interests today known as the Trusts: Rockefeller and Carnegie, despite their anti-competitive behaviors also concentrated the research efforts of what had been dozens of distributed companies leading to greater innovation in cutting-edge industries. The early part of the 20th century was perhaps the most consolidated time of U.S innovative fervor, with the dissolution of the trusts, the methods of research and development pioneered by them were distributed more widely and many of the experts who had previously worked for just a few companies had the freedom to start opening their own laboratories. Edison and Tesla had their historic rivalry during this period, leading to the mass adoption of electricity in houses spread across the entire nation. 

Albert Khan is not a name known by many today, but his legacy is known in the over one billion passanger cars drived across the world today. A key figure in the creation of the modern moving assembly line, he designed factories for industrial giants across the country - notably designing several of Ford's revolutionary factories, along with factories abroad including the famous Stalingrad Tractor Factory.
