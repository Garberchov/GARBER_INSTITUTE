#### US History - 20th Century
#### American Imperialism


For two and a half centuries America has labeled itself and been hailed as a leader for freedom and the power of the people across the world. However, throughout its history, and most notably during the late 19th and beginning of the 20th century, America failed to live up to its ideals in its dealings internationally. The story of American Imperialism across the globe should not be considered in the singular, but in the multiplicity of circumstances and cultural factors that led to America becoming a colonial power so at odds with its basic ideals and founding principles. The age of American Imperialism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries was due to a confluence of circumstances including ascending military power, a booming economy, advancing technology and a cultural impetus for the civilization of nations perceived as backwards comparatively.  At the dawn of the 21st century, American Imperialism changed from an amorphous foreign policy to an ideology of Democratic Imperialism both internationally and domestically which regularly overlooks the ideas and values that made it powerful in the first place. 

Perhaps the most grotesque example of American Imperial ambition is in the Philippines. Spain was the first European power to devote significant resources to the settlement of the Philippines, and by the time of the Spanish-American War a movement for independence and democracy was already underway on the islands. The Spanish-American War was a conflict designed both to ensure American Dominance of the Western Hemisphere and to seize Spanish colonial assets in the Americans and Asia in an attempt to remain a relevant power on the international stage.

Upon victory in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines were ceded to the Americans as spoils of war. This news was not welcome to a majority of Filipinos. A Spanish defeat by the hands of the Americans was an exciting prospect for those who wished to form a republic in the Philippines. However when the Americans occupied and no independence was forthcoming the leaders of the pro-independence and pro-democracy movement felt betrayed. Those independence leaders declared the founding of the First Philippine Republic in 1899 with a governmental structure strikingly similar to that of the U.S. While modern-day America is thrilled with the emergence of new republican nations across the globe, 1899 Americans and political leaders were not. Public sentiment domestically was strongly in favor of an expansion of American values abroad, and the lands gained from the Spanish were seen as the perfect place to start. It was viewed as an insurrection against American rule, even though the independence movement had been forthcoming for several years. The First Philippine Republic declared war on the U.S for what it deemed an illegal occupation and within three years hundreds of thousands were dead due to the conflict and resulting famine. A limited puppet government under the control of the U.S, the Philippine Assembly was eventually established but a military governor would rule over the islands until their independence in 1946, following another invasion and assisting the Americans in throwing off the Imperial Japanese. The U.S's imperial ambitions in the Philippines ended with little blowback, it has largely been forgotten by most American's and most of those who do know the extent of American involvement there remember it more as a time in history where it was acceptable for a nation to do that because it was expected of first tier powers, not as a blatant disregarding of American principles.

Perhaps the other great early 20th century example of American Imperialism was executed by Commodore Matthew Perry in the forceful reopening of Japan, a wholly isolationist nation. Contrary to narratives today, Perry was not the first westerner to ever contact the Japanese. Dutch, Portuguese and British traders had previously attempted to trade with them; however, following significant attempts to convert the population to Catholicism, almost all foreigners were expelled and the nation closed. Only limited trading with the Dutch and Chinese would be allowed until the mid 19th century. The factors that led to Commodore Perry's actions in opening Japan extended far beyond him. The First and Second Opium Wars led to the large-scale ceding of treaty ports to the British, Dutch and French, and the corresponding increase in trade to newly-American California created a stream of Pacific shipping. Moreover, Japan was a geographically useful location for the refueling of steamships and for safe harbors for all Pacific trade. The spirit of Manifest Destiny also played a part as many American traders believed that they had not only the right, but the responsibility to civilize and modernize many Asian nations, thus adding a cultural impetus to Pacific trade. Perry's mission to the Japanese could only be described as miraculously successful. Knowledge of Japanese culture was extremely limited, thus almost all of the issues the Americans wished to raise with the Japanese were addressed to the Emperor, a largely ceremonial post, instead of the Shogun who held all of the power in the country. During both of his naval missions. he sailed into Tokyo Bay, which in Japanese tradition was the place to land to seek an audience with the Emperor instead of the overland route that would lead to meeting with the Shogun. However, despite a lack of cultural understanding the Japanese agreed to open two ports for the refueling of American sailors and returned all stranded American sailors. This was largely due to the Japanese realization following the Opium Wars that they had a military wholly unfit to fight a modern industrial nation - they would have been destroyed and a humiliating peace enforced. While trade was not explicitly allowed, America forced through a Favored Nation clause which gave them any privileges that would first be granted to any other nation. American actions in Japan were notably different than in the Philippines, they knew that they had objective military, economic and technological superiority to the Japanese and could easily beat them in battle, but would gain little from fighting them - Americans fighting with Filipinos was entirely due to not accepting the establishment of an independent democracy in the Philippines.  

The feeling that America should be a civilizing force across the world has never left the collective consciousness of the nation, entering into both World Wars to fight against nations who threatened freedom and democracy across the world broadly demonstrate this. Despite the end of American control of many of its colonial possessions across the world following the Second World War, methods of economic imperialism were practiced across Europe with the Marshall Plan in the 1950s and 1960s despite their humanitarian ideals, and new forms of military imperialism were used in the fight against Communism in Asia and South America throughout the latter half of the 20th century. Even modern-day America has maintained an imperialist spirit completely at odds with the basic ideals and principles of the nation, imperialism over its own citizens in the form of The Patriot Act, and laws just like it or the decades spent fighting in the middle east can only be described as imperialism despite being cloaked in the ideals of freedom and democracy. Democratic Imperialism is a misnomer that America has sold to its people, and the world, as fulfilling the mandate of Americanism despite actions that revolt against the spirit and values of the nation from its earliest days.
