#### How Theodore Roosevelt Changed The American Presidency

Theodore Roosevelt took office amid circumstances difficult for any leader holding the highest office in the land, but took it in his stride as was his nature in an effort to change the way American democracy was structured - forever changing the presidency. Theodore Roosevelt was a contradictory man, congenial and well-spoken while also boisterous and war like; he threw out previous notions of American government and fought to bring the government as an agent of progressive reform to the forefront.

Roosevelt became President following the assassination of William McKinley, taking the oath of office in 1901 having been the Vice President for a mere 194 days. Following his accession to the Presidency, he renounced an in-person State Of The Union address in favor of a short written message as he believed the nation to still be in a state of mourning. This did not translate to the actions of his presidency, as he got right to work molding the presidency in his own image. Early in his first years as President, he took decisive action both at-home and abroad. From his early days as 'The Trust Buster', taking aggressive strides with the nearly defunct Sherman Anti-Trust act and his forceful personality to battle Standard Oil and other monopolies. He believed that if a power was not specifically denied to the presidency, that it should be used if it fit with the president's prerogative as a leader. His belief in a strong, dynamic President who should lead as a coalition builder in the creation of a federal government who would act as leaders of reform on behalf of the people was a bedrock to his presidency and made him broadly popular with Americans during both of his terms.

His actions made him one of the most liberal presidents of the first half of the twentieth century, only being surpassed by his fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, both of whom were heavily focused on the economic matters of their citizens. Despite claims today, Theodore Roosevelt was without doubt a devout capitalist who spoke strongly on the value of incentive in a market economy. However, he believed that the population at large, businessmen in specific, and society in general were better served both monetarily and socially if an economy was regulated to ensure that monopolies did not form and competition in the market was maintained. His fight to make American society more requitable and fair for all, and to ensure public trust in the institutions of government whose power was derived from them was channeled directly into his fight with the Trusts. He took major actions against some of the biggest corporations in human history, splitting them into pieces small enough to ensure market and technological competition that would prove valuable to the public and the shareholders of the company. Theodore Roosevelt's ethos on government was his longest lasting contribution to domestic American politics. He believed that the federal government should do more than just protect the nation's borders and deal with threats from abroad, he believed a strong executive could put in place policies to ensure economic opportunity and help provide for the general welfare to make sure the weakest in the nation were not left behind. He modernized the progressive movement with this sentiment and helped build it into a major political and social player in the American political landscape.

More notable historically are the strides Theodore Roosevelt made with his foreign policy. Pursuing a policy of gunboat diplomacy and the upholding of the Monroe Doctrine, Roosevelt was an active participant in the affairs of nations both in South America and Asia. He believed in both the American right and responsibility to move against what he described as, 'nations of wrongdoing' - justifying his support of a revolution in Panama that led to the construction of the Panama Canal. This technological marvel greatly expanded American naval capabilites by cutting thousands of miles off a trans-oceanic journey. He also changed the way foreign policy was disseminated to the masses, both through his oratorical ability and his revolutionary relationship with the press - specifically on matters of foreign policy. In an effort to simplify how he would deal with foreign nations abroad, he said his policy boiled down to, "Speak softly and carry a big stick" during one of his speeches during his run as Vice President. This was a revolutionary way of positioning himself on issues of massive consequence, how America would deal with other nations, in a way that was understandable and easily repeatable to voters. Roosevelt also created the modern press relationship with the White House, when upon seeing several reporters standing in the rain one day, he gave them a room in which to report stories from the White House. He consistently made an effort to ensure that Americans were continually bought in to the policies of his administration by hosting reporters and trying to keep the White House in the news. Roosevelt further pushed America onto the world stage as an arbiter of freedom and democracy over dictatorship and repression with his 1905 Inaugural Address and 1906 State Of The Union addresses. In the former he said the words that led America to maintain its global presence for over a century, "Toward all other nations, big and small, our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere friendship. We must show not only in our words, but in our deeds that we earnestly desire to secure their goodwill." It can be seen here, in not only his words but his deeds that Theodore Roosevelt created the role of the modern American President in both the leadership of the nation at home and the projection of the power of liberty and democracy across the world.

Theodore Roosevelt is known today as one of the greatest Presidents in the nation's history due to his actions at home and in dealings with nations abroad. However, more notable than his individual actions, bills championed or trusts busted was his role in the creation of the model of a modern American President, and as a result the America that exists as a world power today. He took the role of the President from that of a lead spokesman of a political party to one judged by the character of the individual seeking the office and the ideals he stands for. While his political career is largely thought to have ended in defeat, due to his loss as leader of the progressive party in search of a third term, the ideas he espoused in that final campaign lived far beyond him and eventually became codified as key parts of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and the New Frontier of John F. Kennedy along with central parts of the domestic and foreign policy's of every President from the First World War to the modern day.
