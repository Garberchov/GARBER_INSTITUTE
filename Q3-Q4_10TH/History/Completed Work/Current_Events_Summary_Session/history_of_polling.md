#### US History - Current Events

The modern political campaign is a highly complex, specialized endeavor that runs not only on the energy of the candidate and their supporters but engineered from the data gained in public opinion polling which shapes the race, and the issues run upon. For as long as elections have existed, people have searched for a way to know the results before the ballot box was ever opened. Comments from ancient historians that in the days before the elections on Capitoline Hill in the forum, debates between candidates would rage and the public would stand behind the candidate they thought was right, showing the precursor of our modern polling. From the beginnings of republican government in Athens, the expansion of it in Rome, and becoming synonymized as freedom in Britain, France, and the United States, the public spectacle made of trying to predict the results of any election before it ever took place was a centerpiece of political engagement for the masses. Modern polling has become a highly scientific process, with candidates, campaign managers, and citizens eagerly analyzing the latest polls for updates on the race. However massive failures in recent years have called into question the methodology used, the reliability of the data, and the political leanings of the pollsters themselves. 

The modern system of political polling evolved from the highly unscientific process known as the straw poll. Largely done via magazine or newspaper write-ins, asking readers to check boxes on any number of issues from their political leanings to their favorite meals. These were ripe for fraud and inconsistent results, but the media companies that ran them didn't care as any result could be spun to greater readership and increased revenue. Millions of people wrote in voicing their views on presidential elections, leading to outlandish claims of certainty of election results before they ever started. An eccentric man born over a century ago who changed the political landscape forever in his desire to measure the world around him, George Gallup. Creator of the Gallup method of polling, and founder of perhaps the most prestigious organization in the polling world today he believed that accurately measuring the population's opinion on any number of issues could help businesses better understand customers, candidates better understand voters, and citizens better understand each other. In his Ph.D. dissertation, *An Objective Method For Determining Reader Interest In The Content Of A Newspaper* he set the stage for his later modeling of voter behavior. Most notable to his later success in the political field is his insight into the consolidation of the newspaper industry into fewer papers that would have to take a wider view of the world around them, instead of being wholly specific to either an industry or a group. This entirely parallels the consolidation of the political landscape, in the time before Americans had to make political identity a part of personal identity, where group thought and the party line became replacements for forming opinions based on data and facts. Having accurate knowledge of the thoughts, complaints, and suggestions for a newspaper on how to better serve those who wish to buy it for both information and entertainment is a broadly similar proposition to a candidate wanting to know which issues they should make centerpieces of their campaign and which are only popular in the media but are not influential to the votes of his constituents. Gallup's method for gathering data about newspapers replaced a method based entirely upon the few who took the time to write in and complain, instead of going to a representative mass of customers and asking them directly. This once again neatly parallels the political world, the loud minority on contentious issues like abortion and capital punishment should not guide policy instead the quiet masses who wish to live a life where the government is broadly helpful but not a major part of their everyday lives who care far more about issues related to the economy like inflation and healthcare. With the presidential election of 1936 approaching, he looked to see if he could ascertain the result more accurately than the popular straw polls of the day which he realized largely sampled populations not representative of those who would be voting. He made bold claims to the Washington Post's and New York Herald Tribune's editors assuring them that with a sample size numbering just a few thousand he could more accurately predict the outcome of the presidential contest than the Literary Digest poll with millions of respondents. He predicted the Digest's incorrect pick within 1 percentage point and correctly predicted the winner of the contest to be Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Gallup method quickly spread far and wide, and the Gallup organization became a staple of the political polling world while maintaining the leading edge in new technologies and methods of analysis for their polling.

The success and spread of the Gallup method began the new era of opinion polling, spreading to different industries and markets far beyond politics but never leaving it. The Gallup method allowed the entirety of the U.S population to be broken into strict demographic groups including factors like race, age, location, and political activity making up a representative sample size of between one and three thousand people. However as these demographic groups began to be modeled ever more precisely, the next greatest challenge to increase accuracy became clear: how to predict voter turnout. Turnout year to year and election cycle to election cycle could change dramatically without ever accounting for regional changes based on demographic changes between election cycles, and how those demographic changes affected the population at large adding another order of magnitude to the complexity. While pollsters were still grappling with these new and ever-changing factors, they made perhaps the greatest error in their history in the 1948 presidential election where practically all polling firms and media outlets predicted that Dewey would defeat Truman at the ballot box, where quite the opposite occurred. The lessons learned from that election helped to steadily increase accuracy over the next decades, leading to general complacency even as the nature of polling changed from wholly call-based to a more internet-centric method. As the twenty-first century dawned and the internet expanded, along with general distrust of politicians and any associated with them the gallop method suffered its greatest defeat since 1948 creating a new wave of distrust and calling into question the methodology and reliability of polling in a new political landscape, the 2016 presidential election. While the scale of polling failure has been largely glossed over by the media and strategists from both parties, the scale of the failure should not be ignored. 

While the popular vote did go for Hillary Clinton nationally, it was by a margin considerably less than expected by strategists and pollsters but was minimal compared to the failures suffered by specific polls, notably in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Polls even considered Texas, a historical bastion for the Republican Party to be in contention of going to the Democrats, a call widely publicized and commented upon in the days and weeks following the election day. Two key problems in polling factors that had been minor until the 2016 election came to the fore due to the candidates selected for the 2016 election and the changes in their respective parties they represented: education and predicted turnout. For decades college-educated citizens had been considered amongst the most likely to vote and were generally considered more likely to vote for the Democratic Party while non-college-educated citizens consistently flew under the radar in polls in 2016 as they were amongst the lowest demographics by the turnout. Donald Trump, the Republican Party nominee made this his base and portrayed the Democratic Party as elitist and out-of-touch with most Americans, leading to one of the highest turnouts for this demographic in decades and solidifying them as a central part of the Republican base. Most polls in 2016 considered education not nearly as important as age, location, or race to lead to pollsters largely missing Trump's significant support among non-college-educated voters, specifically white males. By missing the correlation between education and candidate preference, specifically between Clinton and Trump and more largely between the Republican and Democratic parties the turnout among this key, but historically less likely to vote group the polls in these key states were dramatically incorrect leading to false conclusions among candidates and party strategists.

In conclusion, the current standard methodology for political polling is highly advanced, though continually improving and not without significant errors. While the reliability of these methods has been criticized as coming from an era passed in politics, the methodology and logic behind the questions asked and demographics surveyed are sound and as lessons learned with recent errors are corrected they will stay a critical part of the political system. Polling is not an evil that candidates use just to push the buttons of the electorate to divide as much as possible and still get elected, nor is it a savior that makes the candidates automatically do nothing but serve the voter's interest, it is just a tool for recognizing those issues and views that the voters care strongly about. Developed in an era where statistical modeling of large datasets like the electorate of the United States was hugely challenging, polling has elevated politics beyond the candidates and their supporters to greater understandings of popular behavior and proven republican government a model for voter choice around the world.
