The Impact Of The Ohio Senatorial Republican Primary

12 hours after the Associated Press called the Ohio Senatorial Republican Primary for venture capitalist J.D Vance, the ripple effects are becoming more and more widespread. The primary was seen as one of the first referendums on former-President Trump's ability to act as a kingmaker in the Republican Party that he has reforged in his own image, and it was a big victory for him. In the three weeks between former-President Trump's endorsement of J.D Vance and the primary, the senate hopeful competed in a great deal of momentum swung him from the middle of the pack to the clear front runner, with a victory of over 90 thousand votes and 8 percentage points. Even more stunning than his victory over Josh Mandel, a candidate with a broadly similar platform and a long time advocate of former-President Trump was his almost nine percentage point victory over Matt Dolan, a more traditional conservative who hoped to run an anti-Trump message. If this primary is the first to set the tone of what a slate of Republican candidates will look like across the country for midterm elections in 2022, it will have cemented Trump's hold over the Republican party and exile those anti-Trump conservatives who wish for a return to a more traditional party.

The path to overwhelming primary victory did not come easily for J.D Vance, author and former venture capitalist, he spent most of the primary season in the middle of the pack and was host to a number of press blunders including during the endorsement rally from former-President Trump. During the widely televised rally, the former President endorsed him, calling him "J.D Mandel" in a blunder of the two candidates who were vying for his support names. In the three weeks between the endorsement and the primary, Vance pulled ahead of the rest of the pack and was clearly the frontrunner going into the primary however concern was still evident among voters about whether he was the right choice for the party's nomination. Matt Dolan, who ran as an anti-Trump republican hoped to appeal to moderate voters in cities who were tired of the reflexive culture wars of the new Republican Party. This strategy was seemingly successful, as following President Trump's endorsement of Vance, Dolan rose in the polls but was unable to translate it into a victory on primary day and ended up coming in third, only a few thousand votes behind Mandel. This signals a huge shift in the direction the Republican Party is heading, following Trump's defeat by President Biden in the 2020 general election there was a theory that the voters would tire of the Trump style of Republican and return to the more grassroots image of the Republican Party, and this has not presented itself as evidenced by Dolan's defeat by two pro-Trump candidates.

While Vance took a convincing win in the primary, his Democratic opponent won with what can only be described as a landslide. Tim Ryan, a Congressman from Ohio who has served in the House of Representatives since 2013 garnered seventy percent of the democratic vote and won every single precinct across the state, with neither of his opponents Morgan Harper and Traci Johnson being able to put up much a fight. Tim Ryan has garnered endorsements from every establishment Democrat and is ranked highly among the Democratic Party's top candidates. While Ohio has clearly shown itself as a red state in recent election cycles, top strategists from both parties have expressed worry that Vance's inexperience in large party politics and Tim Ryan's broad, centrist message could prove a threat in a senate seat that the Republicans are not prepared to give up, even in this election which appears to be a red-wave in the making. Tim Ryan has proven himself a formidable campaigner and has been touted as having impressive blue-collar credibility and has been called a rising star in the Democratic Party. Vance on the other hand has done nothing to prove himself either a talented campaigner nor gifted in the fundraising aspect of his campaign, both of which have been predicated upon his personal wealth and tying his campaign to that of former-President Trump. In conclusion, the Republican Party's nomination of J.D Vance is a clear marker of former-President Trump's kingmaker status in the Republican Party and if his hand-picked candidates continue to perform well in upcoming primaries, notably in Pennsylvania and Georgia then the 2022 midterm elections will be a referendum on Trumpism in the Republican Party and our nation as a whole.
