The technologies that facilitated westward expansion

The moving of millions of people to lands far from their origins where infrastructure was yet to be developed was a major accomplishment of the early stages of westward expansion, however the invention of a few key technologies brought the frontiers far closer to home. The early stages of westward expansion were the critical steps that created the beachhead by which the government and companies were able to pour in money and resources in order to improve the link between the boarders of known land and the coastal civilization. The number of technologies that were used to facilitate westward expansion was numerous, but the most key of these were the proliferation of railroads, the telegraph and better and cheaper firearms.

The proliferation of railroads that opened up The West to greater passenger and freight travel was pioneered by the transcontinental railroad that got its start through the pacific railroad act. Steam locomotives came about in America in 1830, not far behind Britain though the construction of rail infrastructure did not begin in earnest until the decade after. The construction of the transcontinental railroad was spearheaded by the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroad companies, who would start on opposite ends of the country and build towards each other until the railroad would be completed. A number of legal loopholes were exploited by both companies in their quest to both maximize profits, minimize labor costs and force the government to pay the maximum for construction. While the process of building the railroads was fraught with difficulties, it dramatically decreased the costs and time required for cost to coast travel and became the backbone of a branching rail network that would allow industry and commerce to expand westward and make full advantage of the resources and opportunities the land afforded.

The telegraph is an understated piece of technology that revolutionized America and brought the nation from a loosely connected confederation of peoples to a preeminent world power simply through the communication delay it avoided. America is a truly vast place and was made even vaster through the treaties, purchases and conflicts that expanded The Western border until it was truly from sea to sea. During the early days of westward expansion horse and carriage was the only way for information to travel from east to west, this made developing industry in The Western territories far more difficult as the supply of material and demand for goods could not be accurately forecasted. During the civil war the telegraph was instrumental in the development of strategy for both Union and Confederate troops and further spurred the development of the technology. The ability of news to be reported on one coast and distributed on the other was a major factor in the development of The West, and further advanced the desire for new settlers to come west and stake their claims.

Firearms have long been part of American tradition but their role in hunting and protection during westward expansion was a godsend to those migrants. The West was a dangerous place with a variety of fauna that had not been encountered before and the development of new and innovative weapons by people like Samuel Colt allowed the people to have greater protection at a much reduced cost. The revolvers that are seen as some of the quintessential weapons of The West were some of the most cost effective weapons ever created and their design is so enduring that they are still used today. With minimal logistical support, Western settlers had to become largely self sufficient and having a firearm they could rely upon to consistently work for hunting was a major factor in why the settlement of The West was successful.
