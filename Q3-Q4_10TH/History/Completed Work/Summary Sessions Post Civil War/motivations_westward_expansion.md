## Motivations for Westward Expansion in the United States

The lands of the west always held great promise for the American settlers who set upon the farthest eastern and western shores, the great interior held promises of free land and riches that lured those who wished to make a better lives for themselves. The federal government went to great effort to expand the country and fulfill the promise of a country that spanned from sea to sea, with its peoples inhabiting every square inch of that territory. The westward expansion of the United States was not an overnight process, and was certainly not without controversy and bloodshed but by its zenith, a great migration was taking place of downtrodden city goers becoming pioneers and settlers forming the backbone of the emergent United States. The motivations of settlers that went west in the United States are varied, but the most important ones were the great availability of land and government incentives to settle land, the emergence of the cattle industry and the jobs provided by it and the california gold rush.

The Louisiana Purchase, one of the greatest foreign policy achievements in history was only the start of westward border expansion by the United States, it was quickly followed by the annexation of Texas, the Mexican American Wars, and treaties with Britain to solidify American control of the Oregon territories. With the investment of comparatively little political and economic means the United States had gained control of some of the most prosperous and economically valuable land in the world, from the plains of Nebraska to the shores of Oregon. The economic potential of this land from the first treaty signing to the last was never lost on American leadership irrespective of party of opinion, and the federal government made great efforts to incentivize the migration of its peoples. The Homestead Act was the premier example of this ethos, signed by President Lincoln in 1862, it granted Americans 170 acre plots of public land for just a small fee across the great swathes of land recently acquired by the United States. People of all walks of lives, from workmen tired of factory life, immigrants lured to American shores by promises of cheap land from horizon to horizon and former slaves recently freed. Lincoln was of a Jeffersonian model in large part, saying that the business of the American government was largely "to elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial burdens from all shoulders and to give everyone an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life." The vision of Thomas Jefferson, of the backbone of the American idea of freedom resting upon the shoulders of the family farmer took one step closer to reality 36 years after his death. The conditions of the Homestead Act were quite minor, all one had to do was prove that they had improved the land the settled, live upon it for five years and pay the fee and they received ownership of the land eventually leading to 10% of American land being given to the individual who settled it; a great example of the actualization of the American Dream.

The great expanses of the American West were perfect ground for the creation of an emergent world-leading cattle industry, moving cows from pastures in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and other states to slaughterhouses in Chicago and Des Moines create the myth of the cowboy and inspired young men from across the country to try and make their fortunes on the cattle drive. While the reality of being a cowboy frequently didn't live up to the promise, the industry that they spawned and helped maintain certainly did. The American cattle industry became a world leader, and selective breeding over decades increased yields and profits while improving the quality of an American's diet. The American cattle industry was a major contributor to the growth of the west's economy, and the towns that spawned along the routes of the cattle drive later became some of the American West's greatest metropolitan centers. The end of the cowboy, and the cattle drive came by way of the railroad boom that took the country by storm however the cattle industry only prospered, being able to move cows to slaughterhouses at a fraction of the cost and with greatly increased speed made for greater profits and only increased demand.

The final great factor in the American westward expansion was the California gold rush and the demand for industry it spawned in the West. The discovery of gold in the newly acquired territory of California spawned one of the greatest migrations in the history of America, hundreds of thousands of men went across land and sea to try and find their fortune. Few found it and even fewer came out with more than they went in with, but the rapid migrations of hundreds of thousands led to a great need for housing and support products for the miners leading to great strides being made in the industrialization of an area that barely held people let alone factories only 100 years before. Jeans were one of the first products tailor made for the miners, and they expanded to become a cultural icon that spread far beyond their humble roots. Towns across California from San Francisco was the largest town that was made prosperous by the Gold Rush by thousands of smaller mining towns and small independent businesses were founded as a result of the gold rush, and while many of these towns existed only as places to live a lawless life including rampant prostitution, gambling and drinking some of these towns grew beyond their seedy roots and became major economic centers and towns that are still around today.
