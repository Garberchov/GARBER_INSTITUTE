US History
The Robber Barons of the Industrial United States

Mass industry will be America's greatest lasting achievement for the advancement of world stability and economic opportunity for humans across the globe, industry was not invented in America but it brought precision mass manufacturing from the realms of fantasy to reality. While the wheels of manufacturing revolution began in Britain and France with important inventors and industrialists like James Watt, Joseph-Marie Jacquard, and Antoine Lavoisier it was not them who pioneered the mass manufacturing techniques that changed the nature of our societies, it was the American industrialists who have been slandered over time as the "robber barons" of the industrial world. These men were unquestionably corrupt, unethical and believed in a social darwinian social contract that gave them both the explicit rights and responsibility to mobilize the lower races in pursuit of greater industrial output, however their contributions to the industrial model of our world shouldn't be discounted for their social beliefs as the social good they would create would only be wholly realized decades after they were gone. Men like Carnegie, Vanderbilt, Gates, Morgan and Rockefeller are commonly held up as examples of the failure of human behavior and their achievements decried as simply the destruction of our world for their own personal gain, while discounting the wave of industrialism they helped create which would move billions of people from agricultural poverty to a global urbanized middle class. These men, despite their faults, created our modern global economy.
