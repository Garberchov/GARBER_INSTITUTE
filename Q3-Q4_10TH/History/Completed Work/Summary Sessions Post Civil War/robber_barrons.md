The Robber Barons of the Industrial United States

Mass industry will be America's greatest lasting achievement for the advancement of world stability and economic opportunity for humans across the globe, industry was not invented in America but it brought precision mass manufacturing from the realms of fantasy to reality. While the wheels of manufacturing revolution began in Britain and France with important inventors and industrialists like Thomas Newcomen, James Watt, Joseph-Marie Jacquard, and Antoine Lavoisier it was not them who pioneered the mass manufacturing techniques that changed the nature of our societies, it was the American industrialists who have been slandered over time as the "robber barons" of the industrial world. These men were unquestionably corrupt, unethical and believed in a social darwinian social contract that gave them both the explicit rights and responsibility to mobilize the lower races in pursuit of greater industrial output, however their contributions to the industrial model of our world shouldn't be discounted for their social beliefs as the social good they would create would only be wholly realized decades after they were gone. Men like Carnegie, Vanderbilt, Gates, Morgan and Rockefeller are commonly held up as examples of the failure of human behavior and their achievements decried as simply the destruction of our world for their own personal gain, while discounting the wave of industrialism they helped create which would move billions of people from agricultural poverty to a global urbanized middle class. These men, despite their faults, created our modern global economy. 

In the time before the inventions of Newcomen, Watt, Jacquard, Lavoisier and many others the vast majority of the population lived lives of subsistence farming or other low skill trades, the most advanced of which was likely blacksmithing or mining. The industrial world was yet to be invented, and the birthright of the few was passed on from generation to generation leaving the industrial output of a farmer 1000 BC was hardly different from that of a farmer in 1500 AD. While minor improvements in metal-working made the job slightly easier and the output slightly higher, it was a small change which left the masses in poverty and the wealthy few who leeched off their labor in power and wealth. Two factors changed this: the black death and the Industrial Revolution. The black death started the spiral which would signal the end of feudalism in the western world and increase the value of a peasant's labor such that they could demand greater rights and fees for their labor making industrial mechanisms which increased their output hugely valuable, thus spawning the Industrial Revolution. 

The Industrial Revolution cannot be said to have begun with a single act or invention, it was the culmination of thousands of years of rediscovered learning and myriad economic and cultural factors that made innovation a societally encouraged undertaking. While Newcomen's steam engine was a revolution in modern mechanical design, and Watt's improvements made it both mechanically and economically prosperous machine it was not them who ushered in the Industrial Revolution, it would be the industrialists who harnessed Watt's engine and dozens of other innovator's creations to create the world we live in today.

Rockefeller is today known as the quintessential robber barron - a man of few moral convictions and fewer social niceties, caring not for the plight of the downtrodden he employed but only increasing the already untoward hoards of wealth he already had. He is portrayed as both a ruthless businessman and a corrupt politician, and while he was both of these things he also created the modern American oil industry and personally manufactured the logistical systems that would supply a continent-spanning industrial boom. The story of Rockefeller's rise to his heights as the wealthiest man in the world is salient for the men who would become the robber barron's, and quite opposite those who had been the wealthiest in the pre-industrial era. Rockefeller grew up in a household of strife and familial conflict, his father was a con-artist who dragged his family from city to city to try and make his fortune on any number of schemes. Strangely, this did not push him away from entrepreneurial endeavour but spurred him on to find a job as an assistant bookkeeper at the age of 16, founding his own shop at 20 and grossing $450,000 in his first year. When the Pennsylvania oil boom occurred in the 1860s, he saw that the real opportunity lay not in the drilling but the refining of the oil. In 1864, at the age of 24 he opened his first refinery and by the age of 26 he had consolidated it into the largest in the area. 

By age 31, in 1870 he founded the company for which he would be become both infamous and revered: Standard Oil of Pennsylvania. Within only a few years due to favorable connections to both international shippers, and local railroads he was able to keep production and margins high leading to acquisitions of local refineries allowing him to further consolidate. While Rockefeller was a talented businessman, he was by no means a scientist or engineer which is why his masterstroke during the first few years of Standard Oil was consolidating and increasing the funding for the scientists and engineers that his newly acquired companies already had. This gave his company technological innovations that increased productivity and pushed the boundaries of the rapidly expanding industrial world. Favorable deals with the railroads were useful for the company, but Rockefeller quickly realized that the pipelines would be the future of oil shipping and thus began constructing his own pipelines and terminals which dramatically reduced his costs and allowed him to price gouge his competitors, allowing him to buy up hundreds of wells and refineries. Within a decade Standard Oil completely controlled the US oil industry and was expanding abroad, and this gained the ire of federal regulators. Anti-Trust lawsuits were encouraged by Teddy Roosevelt, however the a suits that broke up Standard Oil became the most profitable thing that Rockefeller had ever done, as every spin-off company from the original beast of Standard Oil was still mostly owned by him, as they expanded over the years his profits soared. Over his life Rockefeller committed some truly heinous acts, and worked his employees extremely hard for meager wages however his legacy as a philanthropist and creator of American industry is undeniable, and his making of the United States' as the preeminent power in the oil industry is still seen today. Without his expansion of oil refining and the pipelines he constructed to transport it, the factories that would power the American industrial boom and the cars and houses that would be built on top of it would not exist.

J.P Morgan is a name that lives on today in one of the world's premier financial institutions, but the story of its rise to prominence and that of its founder is far more complicated than that of a mere bank, as the man and the institution that bears his name helped create some of the biggest industrial powers in American history. J.P Morgan was the sun of another successful financier and banker, and through his family links he helped American based banks find the capital that they lent to new American industrial conglomerates acting as one of the central power brokers of American industry for decades. After being a partner in several firms in his first decades of his career, he eventually reorganized Drexel, Morgan and Company into J.P Morgan and Company in 1895 and created the bank that would underpin American governance and industry for the next century. His foray into the railroad industry came quickly in 1885 and helped to consolidate the disparate railroad companies into larger more centralized companies leading to greater profits at scale, lower costs and improved efficiency. The government quickly started to call on Morgan to help with both the expansion and rehabilitation of struggling railroads, after the panic of 1893 he consolidated almost all of the eastern railroads into just three companies and used his position on the board of directors of almost all major railroads to stop price competition between them. By keeping rates stable he was able to maintain stability both for the profits of each of the companies and allow the railroads to become major sources of shipping for the emerging industrial powers of the northeast and midwest. Besides helping the government keep railroads afloat and profitable after the panic of 1893, Morgan helped to form the Syndicate that averted a Treasury crisis when he helped refill the U.S Government's gold reserves with $62 million in gold.

Morgan solidified his place among the upper echelons of robber barron's by arranging perhaps the greatest merger of American Industry in history, merging Edison General Electric and Thomas-Houston Electric Company to form one of the hallmarks of American industry, General Electric. He also merged disparate steel companies to form United States Steel Corporation, and several different agricultural machinery companies to form International Harvester Company both of which are both still hundred-billion dollar companies. While helping to avert financial crashes and turning American industry from a series of disparate ventures into some of the most impactful companies on the planet, he also donated millions of dollars to charities and other institutions including several museums. While Morgan was less involved in the day to day business of his companies, and the subsequent plight of his employees he was no less responsible for the reprehensible treatment they received nor the impact he had on American industry.

The rise of Andrew Carnegie from Irish street urchin to robber barron signified the coming of a new industrial meritocracy, coming from a poor family who fled from Ireland for greener pastures in America he rose from an unskilled boy in a cotton mill, to a telegraph operator and later preeminent industrial leader. In a world where birth did not define occupation or social class and the aristocratic upper classes were looked down upon as offering neither opportunity nor freedoms to the working classes, Carnegie's coming was proof of a new model of an industrial American society. His transition from talented employee to industrial leader began in earnest in 1859 when he became the superintendent of the Pittsburgh division of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, giving a front row seat to the industrial developments of the day and allowing him to invest in companies that would become fundamental to American life over the next decades. Rising in the ranks of the railroading world, he started venturing to Europe to attract investment and see new technologies that could give his company an edge over competitors and while there mingled with the big players in the European steel industry, he picked up the techniques that would make his company the best in the industry. Carnegie's successes were bolstered by his own in-house engineering teams, adopting the same practices as Rockefeller and his companies where finding new technologies to keep the edge over his competitors became a crusade for his company. By 1900 the profits of the Carnegie Steel Company reached $40 million, worth $1.36 billion today of which 62.5% of which was Carnegie's share. In 1901, Carnegie sold his stake in the company to J.P Morgan's new United States Steel Company for $480 million dollars worth $16.235 billion today in a deal unprecedented in American history setting the stage for the massive mergers that would be J.P Morgans lasting legacy on American industry.

Carnegie's legacy as an industrial magnate is undeniable, though it was even surpassed by his own philanthropic efforts, saying "A man who dies rich dies disgraced" in his article "Wealth" in 1889. His focus on education in his philanthropy is particularly notable, having funded dozens of universities across the world and founding over 2500 libraries of which almost 1700 were spread across the U.S. He had a sincere belief that any person with reasonable access to a wide variety of books and the desire to learn could use them to educate himself and be successful, following in his own footsteps. In his own writings and speeches, Carnegie championed the education as a working boy he had no formal education however he had a childhood mentor who loaned him books which created his insatiable thirst for books, he credits his success to those books as they gave him the thirst for knowledge that led him to prominence. His last major philanthropic effort was to create the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which is an institution whose sole purpose is the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and international peace. The corporation has given major grants to hundreds of universities and funded individual experiments, most notably including the discovery and manufacture of insulin. Carnegie's impact on American industry was incredible, but it was his philanthropy that had the most lasting impact on the world.

The stories of Rockefeller, Morgan and Carnegie are vastly different in their routes through life and the industries they chose to conquer, but the significance of their stories is the same: undeniable. Rockefeller grew up in a broken home and went to work as a clerk at a young age and through shrewd negotiation and hard work he became the wealthiest person in modern history, and created the industrial infrastructure that has powered the U.S economic boom for over a century. Morgan came from wealth but walked away from his father's wealth and became a successful financier of his own right, and helped maintain the U.S economy and was a founding member of the Federal Reserve. Carnegie almost single handedly brought the U.S's steel industry from that of a second rate power to the largest in the world with the most efficient process in the world, and created the model for modern philanthropy will giving away billion of dollars. While it is undoubtedly true that the legacy on worker's rights from all of these men is suspect, and that they all took part in monopolistic behavior that circumvented the fill of the free market, the advances they made off of these steps has paved the way for our modern industrial society.
