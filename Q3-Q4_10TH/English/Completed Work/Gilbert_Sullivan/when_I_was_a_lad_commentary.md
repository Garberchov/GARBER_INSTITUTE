#### The Political Commentary of W.S Gilbert in 'When I Was A Lad' in H.M.S Pinafore

Thesis: W.S Gilbert mixed astute political commentary on the western political world at large and the British political system in specific while satirising the characters in these systems using characters like Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty.
