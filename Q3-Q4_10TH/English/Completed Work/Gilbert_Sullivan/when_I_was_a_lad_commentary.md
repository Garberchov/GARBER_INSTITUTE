#### The Political Commentary of W.S Gilbert in 'When I Was A Lad' in H.M.S Pinafore

Thesis: W.S Gilbert mixed astute political commentary on the western political world at large and the British political system in specific while satirizing the characters in these systems using characters like Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty.

W.S Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, in their play *H.M.S Pinafore* which premiered in 1878 told the story of a young woman who falls in love with a lower class sailor aboard her father's ship - leading to a discussion of class in society. More notable however than the overlaid discussion of social class and economic prosperity in the love lives of people across Victorian England, is the satire Gilbert laid upon the political system of the time. Gilbert mixed astute political commentary on the western political world at large and the British political system in specific while satirizing the characters in these systems using characters like Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty.
