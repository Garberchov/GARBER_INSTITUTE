#### Criticism of Industry in A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court 

*A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court* by Mark Twain is commonly cited as proof that the science fiction genre can produce works that are more than just fantastical stories, but impactful criticisms of the lives we actually live and that is indisputable. Twain's most impactful story in the science fiction genre introduced plot devices that have become mainstays of the genre, but even more important than his impact as a benchmark of science fiction greatness is his criticism of the modern industrial world. Written in 1896 many of the inventions the Hank Morgan, known as 'The Boss' uses were revolutionary for the world Twain lived in, however many of the modern interpretations of the story as either a manifesto on the evil of technology or as an endorsement as technology as a way to solve the world's problems miss the point of technology in the story entirely - and our modern world in the same way. Twain's criticism of modern life in *A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court* is neither an endorsement nor an opposition of technology in the world, it is a statement that fundamental human values should be imparted onto the tools we use regardless of their inherent technological value.

*A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court* has been adopted as reference material by both technologist and primitivist groups however it is not a ringing endorsement of either, but an endorsement of basic humanity and a message that tools should reference them. A great example of this is when 'The Boss' uses gunpowder, a common substance in his time for a variety of military and industrial applications to blow up Merlin's tower which cements his position as a sorcerer among the people. This event can be turned to either side of this debate, saying that 'The Boss' manipulating the people and selling his use of practical technologies as sorcery was evidence of the harm that technology can do both to people and to society. While it was undoubtedly manipulative and underhanded to do it this way, the counter-argument to this is that the people of this time would not have accepted an outsider coming in with technology that was so far beyond their time, and 'The Boss' needed to reach a preeminent position in society in order to implement these technologies into their world for the good of society. The truth lays in neither of these arguments, Twain wanted technology to be a reflection of the user, in the case of 'The Boss' he was both manipulative but only for his causes which were meant for the good of the people. In *A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court*, there are no other main characters besides Hank Morgan and thus the only person reflected in the technology of the story is Hank Morgan, Clarence is simply a personification of Hank Morgan onto someone born in the times of King Arthur. Thus the technology of the times, coming from only one source and mainly used only by one person personifies Morgan's fight against the injustice of the times in the form of the Catholic Church and the Aristocracy. 

This fight is best seen when using modern technology Morgan fights Sir Sagramor and the knights that follow him, he defeats almost a dozen knights before his weapon, a lasso is taken from him and then he produces a revolver. He then proceeds to kill and rout five hundred knights.
