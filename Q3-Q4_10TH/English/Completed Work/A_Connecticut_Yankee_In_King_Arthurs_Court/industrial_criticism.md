#### Criticism of Industry in A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court 

*A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court* by Mark Twain is commonly cited as proof that the science fiction genre can produce works that are more than just fantastical stories, but impactful criticisms of the lives we actually live and that is indisputable. Twain's most impactful story in the science fiction genre introduced plot devices that have become mainstays of the genre, but even more important than his impact as a benchmark of science fiction greatness is his criticism of the modern industrial world. Written in 1896 many of the inventions the main character, known as 'The Boss' uses were revolutionary for the world Twain lived in, however many of the modern interpretations of the story as either a manifesto on the evil of technology or as an endorsement as technology as a way to solve the world's problems miss the point of technology in the story entirely - and our modern world in the same way. Twain's criticism of modern life in *A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court* is neither an endorsement nor an opposition of technology in the world, it is a statement that fundamental human values should be imparted onto the tools we use regardless of their inherent technological value.
