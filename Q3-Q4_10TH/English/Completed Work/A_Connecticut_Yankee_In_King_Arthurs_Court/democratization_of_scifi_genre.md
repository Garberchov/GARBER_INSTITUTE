Science fiction today is thought of as a fundamental genre of literature, home to great works that have had a profound impact on the world but in the border between that and fantasy, that of mysticism is one ill defined and not considered at all until about a century ago. The early works of the genre straddled this divide, dipping into strongest elements of both and becoming essential hallmarks of the genre. While the most well known of these, written by Shelly, Wells, and Verne established the genre as capable of powerful works, *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court* by Mark Twain was the first to truly democratize science fiction even while incorporating strong elements from fantasy.
