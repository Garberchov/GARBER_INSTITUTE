Science fiction today is thought of as a fundamental genre of literature, home to great works that have had a profound impact on the world. However in the border between that and fantasy, that of mysticism is one ill defined and not considered at all until about a century ago. The early works of the genre straddled this divide, dipping into strongest elements of both and becoming essential hallmarks of the genre. While the most well known of these, written by Shelly, Wells, and Verne established the genre as capable of powerful works, *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court* by Mark Twain was the first to truly democratize science fiction even while incorporating strong elements from fantasy.

*A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court*, written in 1889 was a revelation in the science fiction genre, taking plot devices that would later become staples including time travel, wizardry and advanced technology into the mainstream. It tells the story of Hank Morgan, frequently called 'The Boss' throughout the story who is taken back in time to the era of the Arthurian round table, while the social criticism  is notable, far more notable to the growth of the genre was the mastery by which Twain integrated central concepts of fantasy while creating the modern science fiction genre by grounding the plot in reality.
