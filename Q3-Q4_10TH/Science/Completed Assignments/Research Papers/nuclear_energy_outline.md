Nuclear Energy Outline

Explaining the Trend Toward Nuclear Energy:  Chemistry, Misconceptions & the Public
Explain the chemistry (not primarily the economics - give me the chemistry) behind the generation of nuclear power, including why the chemistry is either beneficial or harmful to the environment.  What is "the" one best reason to expand the use OR abolish the use of nuclear energy? 
Debunk one commonly held misconception about the generation or use (these are different things) of nuclear energy. 
Are Fukushima or Chernobyl good examples of BAD nuclear technology? Or were other controllable elements at play? In your opinion based upon your research - how are these types of disasters avoided -- and how can the bad publicity be neutralized? 


Thesis: Nuclear energy is one of the most misunderstood technologies of the modern world, conceptualized due to dramatization from hollywood and the media, it is the safest form of energy generation currently which can be proven via its chemistry to be both safe and economically viable.

BParagraph1: 

        - Chemistry behind nuclear reactions with a basic history of how the technology was developed.
        - How the chemistry(and process) had advanced over the decades
        - The different kinds of waste produced from nuclear reactors

BParagraph2:

        - Best reason to expand nuclear energy
        - Accept that nuclear energy has led to disasters in the past, but discuss modern regulatory standards in US, EU(france specifically) and China which are the leaders in  nuclear energy

BParagraph3:

        - Nuclear disasters throughout history, and what caused them
        - Discuss new types of nuclear energy, and the chemistry behind them

BParagraph4:

        - Lack of comprehensive storage for nuclear waste, due to lack of political will to expand nuclear power plants(no need for more storage) or shut them down completely(large amounts of carbon free power, and baseline for grid)
        - The media's role in personifying nuclear energy as a major threat to humankind
