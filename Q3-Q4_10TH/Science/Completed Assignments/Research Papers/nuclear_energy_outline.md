Explaining the Trend Toward Nuclear Energy:  Chemistry, Misconceptions & the Public
Explain the chemistry (not primarily the economics - give me the chemistry) behind the generation of nuclear power, including why the chemistry is either beneficial or harmful to the environment.  What is "the" one best reason to expand the use OR abolish the use of nuclear energy? 
Debunk one commonly held misconception about the generation or use (these are different things) of nuclear energy. 
Are Fukushima or Chernobyl good examples of BAD nuclear technology? Or were other controllable elements at play? In your opinion based upon your research - how are these types of disasters avoided -- and how can the bad publicity be neutralized? 


Thesis: Nuclear energy is one of the most misunderstood technologies of the modern world, conceptualized due to dramatization from hollywood and the media, it is the safest form of energy generation currently which can be proven via its chemistry to be both safe and economically viable.
