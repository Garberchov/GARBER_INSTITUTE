The chemistry, impact and economics of carbon-neutral kerosene

INTRO: LARGE AMOUNT OF CARBON FROM SHIPS, PLANES, AIR BUT TRAINS MORE EFFICIENT. IF SHIPS PLANES AIR COULD BE MADE CARBON NEUTRAL WOULD BE BIG STEP IN FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE. IF PROCESS BY WEFORUM IS PROVEN COULD BE GOOD FOR DESERT ECONOMIES. IEA PREDICTS 10% AVIATION FUEL CARBON-NEUTRAL BY 2030 AND 20% 2040(WHICH IS CONSERVATIVE)
