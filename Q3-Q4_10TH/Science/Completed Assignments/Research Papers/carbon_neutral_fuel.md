The chemistry, impact and economics of carbon-neutral kerosene

<!-- INTRO: LARGE AMOUNT OF CARBON FROM SHIPS, PLANES, AIR BUT TRAINS MORE EFFICIENT. IF SHIPS PLANES AIR COULD BE MADE CARBON NEUTRAL WOULD BE BIG STEP IN FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE. IF PROCESS BY WEFORUM IS PROVEN COULD BE GOOD FOR DESERT ECONOMIES. IEA PREDICTS 10% AVIATION FUEL CARBON-NEUTRAL BY 2030 AND 20% 2040(WHICH IS CONSERVATIVE) -->

Climate change is an existential threat to humanity and every manner of solutions in all sector of our economy and life as a species will have to go through drastic changes to save our planet and species from the life and deaths changes caused by climate change. Despite rhetoric bemoaning the issue as a spoiler to whip the masses into hysteria and the world at large into panic, the issue is ultimatum from our past choices and the choices we make today and every day from now on will decide whether or not we deserve to have a future. Transportation as a whole is one of the most important sectors of our economy, linking nations and peoples together in ways that combine the collective consciousness of humanity. Unfortunately, transportation is an intensely emissions intensive industry making up 14% of global emissions in 2014 according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Thus, lowering the emissions of transportation including rail, road, and air is a major challenge for the protection of our future and will have to be accomplished in a number of ways. Petroleum based fuels are by far the most commonly used power sources for vehicles of all kinds across the world, making them constant and hard to replace emitters of Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide and one of the most potentially impactful solutions to the transportation emissions problem is carbon neutral fuels.
