The chemistry, impact and economics of carbon-neutral kerosene


#### Introduction

Climate change is an existential threat to humanity and every manner of solutions in all sectors of the economy  will have to go through drastic changes to save our planet and species. Despite rhetoric bemoaning the issue as a spoiler to whip the masses into hysteria, the issue is an ultimatum from our past choices and the choices we make today and every day from now on will decide whether or not we deserve to have a future. Transportation as a whole is one of the most important sectors of our economy, linking nations and peoples together in ways that combine the collective consciousness of humanity. Unfortunately, transportation is an intensely emissions intensive industry combining to 14% of global emissions in 2014 according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Thus, lowering the emissions from transportation including rail, road, sea, and air is a major challenge for the protection of our future. Petroleum based fuels are by far the most commonly used power sources for vehicles of all kinds across the world, making them constant and hard to replace emitters of Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide. One of the most potentially impactful solutions to the transportation emissions problem is carbon neutral petroleum fuels. 

Carbon neutral petroleum based fuel sources are an attractive proposition for industry, government and consumers alike due to not requiring special infrastructure like car charging stations for electric cars and not requiring changes in manufacturing for the engines of cars, allowing carbon neutral petroleum fuels to be a great interim solution for transportation emissions. Instead of requiring the continued extraction of crude oil, an environmentally taxing process leading to frequent environmental damage and the eventual outpouring of emissions that comes from the consumption of such fuels, carbon neutral fuels can be made from captured CO2 using renewable hydrogen and energy. One of the biggest breakthroughs in this area has come from a team at [Oxford](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20214-z) who published a paper reporting a synthetic process to convert carbon dioxide into aviation grade jet fuel using a revolutionary and inexpensive iron based catalyst, allowing for mass production. 


#### Process

The process pioneered by the team at Oxford, currently the highest efficiency process published publicly uses a revolutionary Iron-Manganese-Potassium catalyst made using the Organic Combustion Method, which can hydrogenate carbon dioxide to the purity of jet fuel at a conversion rate of 38.2% which is extraordinarily efficient. Hydrogenation is the process of reducing or saturating, as in this case, organic compounds almost always done with a catalyst. In the process, other valuable gases and materials are made such as methane, ethylene which is useful in the chemicals industry, propylene which is useful as a fuel, and butene which is useful for rubber production. These petrochemicals are currently only made via the extraction of crude oil, so this also represents a major source of emissions reduction. 'Jet Fuel' is the common term for the linear and branched alkanes, compounds that are made entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms bonded via single bonds, and cycloalkanes which are saturated hydrocarbons arranged in a ring all bonded via single bonds. The typical length for these chains to maximize efficiency in combustion is C8-C16, while they can run as long as C18. However the process of converting Carbon Dioxide, which is a thermodynamically stable and chemically inert molecule which are two of the reasons it is so difficult to deal with as a pollutant, into hydrocarbon chains is extremely difficult and quite energy intensive. The more efficient of the two major processes, which is completed via reducing CO2 to CO and hydrogenating CO to longer chain hydrocarbons and then using industrial processes such as distillation. This process is much more difficult to complete than the less efficient process, and the success and furthering of the method is dependent on a cheap but highly efficient catalyst which the Oxford team has found in the Fe-Mg-K catalyst. As previously stated, the catalyst that the Oxford team pioneered has a CO2 conversion rate of 38.2% and of these converted molecules 47.8% are converted to the optimal jet-fuel range of C8-C18. This is a groundbreaking discovery, and with a reaction time of only 20 hours which is comparable to the distillation times for crude oil makes it highly competitive.
