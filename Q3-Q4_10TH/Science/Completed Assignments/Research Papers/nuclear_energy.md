Nuclear Energy

Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima - places that bring to mind thoughts of imminent disaster for nuclear power plants everywhere, with meltdowns as catastrophic as the bombs we have only dropped twice: this is a delusion. In the events of Chernobyl which is thought of as perhaps the worst nuclear disaster in history, was predicated upon an inadequate design and picking political loyalty over training for staffing, 39 people died. Jellyfish kill more people every year. Fukushima, a nuclear disaster which only came about due to a massive confluence of circumstance including one of the biggest earthquakes in history, a tsunami and the decay heat not being diminished quickly enough, killed only one person due to the radiator exposure though approximately 573 died due to panic from the evacuation and damaged infrastructure. At Three Mile Island, the U.S's greatest nuclear failure which set the trend for flat-lining construction for decades: no deaths. Nuclear energy is one of the most misunderstood technologies of the modern world, conceptualized due to dramatization from hollywood and the media, it is the safest form of energy generation currently which can be proven via its chemistry to be both safe and economically viable.
