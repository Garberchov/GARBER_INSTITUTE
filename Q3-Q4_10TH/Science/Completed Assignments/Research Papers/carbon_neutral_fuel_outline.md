INTRO: LARGE AMOUNT OF CARBON FROM SHIPS, PLANES, AIR BUT TRAINS MORE EFFICIENT. IF SHIPS PLANES AIR COULD BE MADE CARBON NEUTRAL WOULD BE BIG STEP IN FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE. IF PROCESS BY WEFORUM IS PROVEN COULD BE GOOD FOR DESERT ECONOMIES. IEA PREDICTS 10% AVIATION FUEL CARBON-NEUTRAL BY 2030 AND 20% 2040(WHICH IS CONSERVATIVE) 

Split economics and impact into sectors(Passenger vehicles, freight vehicles, aircraft, ships)
 
Outline:
	-Intro
		Intro Paragraph with basic run down of importance of climate solutions + Thesis
		Basic Explanation of process and reasons why carbon neutral fuel is a unique proposition for the future
	
	-Chemistry:
		Current Process
	-Impact
		Impact on Passenger Vehicle Emissions (Low until large cost decreases have been made, but a huge potential market as a transition fuel during our switch from fossil fuels to electric/hydrogen options.)
		Impact on Freight Vehicle Emissions (Low until large cost decreases have been made, but another large market even after the transition to electric/hydrogen options due to higher energy density)
		Impact on Aircraft Emissions (The greatest current market, as aircraft are extremely energy intensive and have limited current options for other energy storage options.)
		Impact on Ship Emissions (Lowest until largest cost decreases have been made, lowest shipping margin and thus requires lowest fuel costs but a potential replacement for 55 thousand vessel for 3% of the world's emissions.)
