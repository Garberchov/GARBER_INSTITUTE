INTRO: LARGE AMOUNT OF CARBON FROM SHIPS, PLANES, AIR BUT TRAINS MORE EFFICIENT. IF SHIPS PLANES AIR COULD BE MADE CARBON NEUTRAL WOULD BE BIG STEP IN FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE. IF PROCESS BY WEFORUM IS PROVEN COULD BE GOOD FOR DESERT ECONOMIES. IEA PREDICTS 10% AVIATION FUEL CARBON-NEUTRAL BY 2030 AND 20% 2040(WHICH IS CONSERVATIVE) 

Split economics and impact into sectors(Passenger vehicles, freight vehicles, aircraft, ships)
 
Outline:
	-Intro
		Intro Paragraph with basic run down of importance of climate solutions + Thesis
		Basic Explanation of process and reasons why carbon neutral fuel is a unique proposition for the future
	
	-Chemistry:
		Current Process
	-Impact
		Impact on Passenger Vehicle Emissions (Low until large cost decreases have been made, but a huge potential market as a transition fuel during our switch from fossil fuels to electric/hydrogen options.)
		Impact on Freight Vehicle Emissions (Low until large cost decreases have been made, but another large market even after the transition to electric/hydrogen options due to higher energy density)
		Impact on Aircraft Emissions (The greatest current market, as aircraft are extremely energy intensive and have limited current options for other energy storage options.)
		Impact on Ship Emissions (Lowest until largest cost decreases have been made, lowest shipping margin and thus requires lowest fuel costs but a potential replacement for 55 thousand vessel for 3% of the world's emissions.)

	-Economics
		Cost(Current costs and issues with decreasing the cost and projections for demand and cost over time if large scale investments can be made)
		Mass Production(The different processes and how some of them are more advantageous, specifically the one from oxford, and how it will decrease investment costs and increase production over time)

Summary:
	Summary of the process to create carbon neutral jet fuel(it says only jet fuel because it is currently the most economically viable way). Talks about how it can be necessary for decarbonization. The first plant has been funded and construction has begun for the plant to come online in 2023 but costs per liter are quite high but will become cheaper as the process is scaled but high initial investments are required.

Summary:
	Talks about the major scientific breakthrough from Oxford that was published in the nature journal, showing a new method of creating competitively priced carbon neutral jet fuel. 
	So what’s next for the new process? Edwards and his team say they will be collaborating with industry to build the world’s first net zero emission aviation fuel demonstration plant. “The main challenges will be the cost of CO2 and H2,” Yao said, “but we believe that, with the development of CO2 capture technology and cheaper H2 generated via renewable energy, the cost will be significantly reduced.”

Summary:
	The atmosfair project is producing sustainable kerosene that can be blended with normal kerosene to decrease emissions, a good stop-gap measure to decrease emissions until greater quantities of zero emission jet fuel become available.

Summary:
	BP's drop in SAF fuel, meant as an additive for jet fuel to reduce emissions by up to 80% over its lifetime is a good start to reducing airline emissions and makes use of cast off organic products like cooking oil in its fuel creation.

Summary:
	Talks about the major scientific breakthrough from Oxford that was published in the nature journal, showing a new method of creating competitively priced carbon neutral jet fuel. 
	In tests lasting 20 hours, the process converted 38 percent of carbon dioxide inside the reactor into jet fuel and other substances including water, propylene and ethylene, reports Bob Yirka for Phys.org. Jet fuel made up nearly half of the various byproducts from the chemical reactions. Moreover, some of these byproducts, such as ethylene and propylene, can be used to make plastics, per Science News.
