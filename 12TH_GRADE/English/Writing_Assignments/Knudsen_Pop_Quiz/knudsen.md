### Response:

In a remark to my Mom this morning, I said that William Signius Knudsen(originally Signius Wilhelm Poul Knudsen) was my hero. While this remark was somewhat offhand, I stand by it. I consider plenty of people to be heroes, but Knudsen is *my* hero. From the first time I read about him, I was struck by his story, his philosophy, and his character - he held characteristics that I not only aspire to but look to as a model for my own life. He was born in Denmark in 1879 and this is where the first story about his character begins: his mother desperately wanted him to take up music in some way, but after trying--and not caring for--the violin, his mother bought him a piano. He refused to take lessons but instead went to the mid-day changing of the guard outside the palace of King Christian IX. He would listen to the orchestra at the changing of the guard *during his lunch break*, go back to work, and when he got home try to replicate the music he heard. Before long, he was "a one-piece orchestra for the family gatherings and the neighborhood dancing parties,"(Beasley, p. 9). This story is a testament to his character: he was determined, independent, and resourceful outside of all measures. He immigrated to America in 1900 at the age of 20 or 21(he was born in 1879, but I cannot find the date when he arrived) and passed through Ellis Island just like millions of others - he came to America seeking opportunity, and found it. His first job was as a janitor, then as a "bucker-up" in a shipyard(he would help lift steel plates into place so that they could be riveted), and then got a job at the  Erie Railroad shop. However in his first days in America, there is another story that exemplifies his character: in order to learn English, in his free hours he would sit on the stoop and talk to children. In doing so, he learned "the simple language of children--direct, forceful, plain speech,"(Beasley, p. 12). This is the ingenuity, persistence, and resourcefulness that I think characterizes a hero of mine outside of all other attributes.

His career began to accelerate when he was hired by the Keim mills in Buffalo manufacturing bicycles. Rapidly rising through the ranks and helping to secure contracts with Henry Ford for Keim to act as a satellite assembler for Ford's cars. Eventually, Keim was bought by Ford--not for its tools or its factory, but for its executives: Knudsen being one of them. About 70 senior Keim executives and their families were shipped to Detroit to work for Ford, proving instrumental in the ramp-up that would make the Model T one of the best-selling cars in history to this day. This is where I think Knudsen's heroism, to me, is most evident: his assistance in the development of "Ford's" assembly line. In the Keim factories in Buffalo, he had already been experimenting with making the "noses all point the same way", so that the product flowed more smoothly as labor was done on it. Later, when the president of Chevrolet(where Ford outproduced them 13-to-1), his simple rallying call to dealers and the company at large was "vun-for-vun" - and then did it, outproducing Ford for most of the 1930s. While this may not seem heroic to most, mass production has been something I idolized and found *entrancing* since I was a child watching "How It's Made", that Knudsen was instrumental in the development of this would be enough to make him *a* hero to me. That he is *my* hero is because of his personal philosophy and character.

Knudsen was, in the spirit of the time, a "self-made man". He was not callous in this, he recognized that his circumstances--a single, athletic, well-educated man--made him more likely to succeed than others, but his worship of hard work while he did so was genuine. All throughout his life, from working as an apprentice to a wholesaler in Denmark, the shipyards in New York, the Erie Railroad, Ford, president of Chevrolet and then the entirety of General Motors, and then as a "dollar-a-year man"(and Lieutenant General) in the War Department coordinating war production during World War II, he worshipped hard work as that which makes individuals, societies, and nations great, prosperous, and virtuous. In the introduction to the Beasley biography, Knudsen wrote, "We must reinstate common labor to its rightful position as the foundation of all industry, even if we have to use college instruction in pick and shovel work rather than atomic energy, for physical work is the salt of the earth, and sound bodies produce healthy brains."(Beasley, Introduction). This is the modern-day equivalent of Cleanthes carrying water to pay for his life as a philosopher, but Knudsen's philosophy *was* work. He raised a family, was a good husband, and a leader of his local congregation but his life was doing work that he believed in and he enjoyed. He was a man who can only be called "industrious" in the most literal sense of the word, yeoman-like in his virtue as fundamentally creative and productive. His mission was to create, build, make, and do so in a way that was efficient, effective, and virtuous. Nothing else so embodies the virtues--and life--that I aspire to: a life of hard work and toil that in its essence makes things out of nothing, increasing the sum total of human prosperity. While Henry Ford might have the greater name recognition, I believe Knudsen well may have the longer legacy: mass production, the armaments that won World War II, and the philosophy of hard work and industry that he lived and breathed. He is my hero.

My heart is racing - I can FEEL your excitement!! 95 / 100 -- only demerit points for run ons, and grammar hiccups that we MUST fix pre collegiate writing.  For a pop quiz - you had your idea and gave the excitement back to me. But as we advance to next stage we have to be sure that even in short form, all the pieces (structure, content, presentation) are on par.
