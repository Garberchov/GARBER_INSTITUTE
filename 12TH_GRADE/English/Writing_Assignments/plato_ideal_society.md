The thought of an earthly utopia appears inherent in the human condition, an aspiration for a perfect society and a perfect world free from the evils of the world. Plato, in his *Republic*, outlines his ideal society, though instead of a fundamental preconception that the world in his society will be perfect, it is instead a society designed in full awareness of the failures and inherent nature of the human condition. Plato's ideal society is unique in the modern Western mind, in his stratification of society into definitive classes, and his categorical rejection of democracy as incapable of producing a just society. 

The first class of Plato's society is the Guardians, those charged with the protection of the state. This might seem somewhat backwards, as Athens and almost all of the other states - with the notable exception of Sparta - used citizen soldiers who fought, and then returned to their farms. This objection was voiced by Glaucon saying, "But can't the citizens fight for themselves?" (Lee 62), to which Socrates responds, "Not if the principle, on which we all ... agreed when we started constructing our state ... that one man could not do more than one job or profession well."(Lee 62). This is a critical part in the stratification of the society, that a singular profession: violence, requires special training in both the physical and philosophical realms in order to perform it well. This special training, and their nature that allows them to both be purveyors of violence and recievers of philosophical tenets, places them as the ideal leaders of a society. This is well exemplified in the discussion between Socrates and Glaucon regarding the need for both philosophical and physical training, "that each must have the keen perceptions and speed of pursuit of his quarry, and also strength to fight if need be when he catches it ... And also courage, if he is to fight well ... And no hourse or dog or any other creature can be courageous if it has no spirit ... We know therefore what physical qualities our Guardians must have." (Lee 64). This seeming simplicity of the Guardians is deceptive, as Socrates immediately raises the question of the temperament of the Guardians, "But if they have these qualities, Glaucon, won't they be agressive in their behavior to each other and to the rest of the community ... And yet they ought to be gentle towards theri fellow citizens and dangerous only to their enemies; otherwise they will destroy each other before others can destroy them."(Lee 64). This is the critical complexity of the Guardians, that they must be in turn agressive and restrained. Socrates compares them to guard dogs, knowing friend or foe simply by recognition, a form of knowledge, and philosophy is nothing if not the love of knowledge. By stepping through the ideological construction of a Guardian, Socrates creates the pathway to which enlightened leadership of a society can be achieved.
