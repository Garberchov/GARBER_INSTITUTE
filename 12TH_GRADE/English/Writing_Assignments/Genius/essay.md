### Geniuses

Our society has desired a definition of genius for centuries in order to build the twelve step program to genius. Our modern search for the definition of genius for our own purposes first requires a look at the ancients' conception of it: it comes from Latin, meaning "to bring into being." This definition is not helpful, but how the Romans saw genius is--as a spirit that accompanied individuals throughout their lives guiding them to greater things, not as a trait. We today see genius as a trait, a quality that some people have and others do not, but for the Romans, it was a spirit that could be called upon to help them in their endeavors. This is a more helpful definition, as it allows for the possibility of genius in everyone, not just a select few - it allows for genius for all who do not stamp it out. In a search to quantify, disect, and understand the quality of two of the greatest examples of genius in history, three examples emerged. While not the intention, in reading about the lives of Alfred Sloan and Leonardo da Vinci, a spectrum of genius began to emerge: on one end, a genius of organization and structure, of control and information processing; on the other, a genius of creativity and childlike wonder, of continual learning and exploration. With this spectrum in mind, a half-way house of a genius emerged, whos spectacular success and even more spectacular failure, seemed to be a result of just enough of each to make great strides but never to keep them: our third genius, Billy Durant.

Alfred Sloan's genius, the nature of spirit that guided him, was one of organizational structure and control. Born in 1875, Sloan studied engineering but left the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work for a ball bearing company in New Jersey called Hyatt Roller Bearing. After leaving briefly to work in refrigeration his Father and an associate of his put together a new round of investment to allow the company to stay in business under the condition that Sloan would be put in charge. In 1898, with 6 months to see what he could do with it, and with the assistance of Peter Steenstrup, he took charge of Hyatt. As Sloan put it tersely in his autobiography/management primer, "At the end of six months we had made some advances in volume and economy, and a $12,000 profit, and that put the business in a position where we recognized that it might be successful. I assumed the high title of general manager. I could not know that throuhg Hyatt I had entered one of the headwaters of General Motors (Sloan, 18)". While this is an impressive start, the first great manifestation of his genius was in 1916, when Billy Durant offered to buy Hyatt and fold it in as part supplier(and seller) under the General Motors umbrella. Sloan's clear and concise calculation of the market and organizational conditions that made the sale worthwhile can only be described as genius, "Ford alone represented about half of the sales. This business if lost could not be replaced because no new customer of such magnitude existed ... Second, I recognized that the kind of roller bearing we made at that time was destined through the evolution of automobile design to be supplemented and perhaps superseded by other types. And what then?"(Sloan, 23). Sloan's genius allowed him to see that the good-days of a one-product Hyatt could not last, and when the opportunity to be absorbed by General Motors came, he took it. Sloan's rise to President of General Motors in 1923 was rapid and his actions in that post deserving of plaudits, but one thing during his time as just one of many high-level executives at General Motors will go down as his greatest stroke of genius, making his name synonymous with three generations of management practice: he saw the problems that the decentralized, uncoordinated, intra-competitive structure of General Motors was causing *before* they became a problem, and offered a plan that would solve them. 

<!-- Paragraph about when everything worked under Durant and then didn't, the problems, and Sloan's plan to fix them. Not being adopted, everything going tits up, and then being implemented -->
This plan was the direct descendant of the crisis of 1920, based on the organizational structure put in place by Durant in his rapid expansion of General Motors into a behemoth of many concerns, and the lack of coordination between operators of specific divisions of General Motors, when the industry stoped growing by leaps and bounds and finally contracted, General Motors was caught out. Sloan described the general situation well, preceeded immediately by his own admission that he didn't see it coming either, "Total corporation inventories in January 120 had stood at $137 million; in April at $168 million; in June at $185 million; in October at $209 million, exceeding by $59 million the limit set in May ... In September the bottom dropped out of the automobile market. ... Mr. Durant, supported by the division sales manager, attempted for a time to maintain prices ... In November all the major car-producing divisions, except Buick and Cadillac, had virtually shut down their plants, and those two were operating at reduced rates ... Before these events took place I had become increasingly distrubed by the trend of affairs inside General Motors. In late 1919 and early 1920 I developed a plan of organization intended to correct deficiencies in the operating organization, and presented itto Mr. Durant. He appeared to accept it favorably, though he did nothing about it. I think this was due in part to the fact that he was not prepared then to take up organizational matters; he was over-burdened with all manner of immediate operating and personal financial problems which made it extremely difficult for him to consider a broad plan of this kind (Sloan 31)." While that last sentence may seem a forgiveness for Durant's failure here, it was in-fact a cutting indictment of his management style: in Sloan's organizational genius, he saw that having an organization dependent on their chief executive for day-to-day management and operational decisions was strictly limiting, and that the organization needed to be restructured to allow for more coordination between divisions and a strong central staff organization be establsished.
