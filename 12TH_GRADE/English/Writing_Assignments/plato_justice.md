### Plato's Republic
#### Prompt: The original theme of *The Republic* is the nature of justice. Describe three conceptions of justice presented in the text, and explain Socrates' parallels between justice in the individual and justice in society/the state. Which of these conceptions of justice do you find most compelling? Why? Where does each fail?

*Note: This is done using the Penguin Classics edition of *The Republic* translated by Desmond Lee, ISBN 978-0-140-45511-3 - thus, any differences in page numbers are due to the edition used.*
