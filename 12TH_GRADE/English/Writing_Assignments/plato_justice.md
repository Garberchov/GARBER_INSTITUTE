### Plato's Republic
#### Prompt: The original theme of *The Republic* is the nature of justice. Describe three conceptions of justice presented in the text, and explain Socrates' parallels between justice in the individual and justice in society/the state. Which of these conceptions of justice do you find most compelling? Why? Where does each fail?

*Note: This is done using the Penguin Classics edition of *The Republic* translated by Desmond Lee, ISBN 978-0-140-45511-3 - thus, any differences in page numbers are due to the edition used.*

#### Outline 
 - Polemarchus' conception of justice is hurting one's enemies and helping one's friends. (Lee 8)
    - Socrates' refutation of this is that we are not good at judging who our friends and enemies are, thus we may end up hurting our friends and helping our enemies. More than this, it is not in our best interest to hurt our enemies - we should instead try to make them our friends. (Lee 12)
 - Thrasymachus' conception of justice is that justice is what is benefical to the stronger party, and that general societal conventions of justice as protection for the weak against the strong is contrary to nature. (Lee 18)
    - Socrates' first demands that Thrasymachus actually define what "beneficial" means, is it what is *ACTUALLY* benefical, or merely what is thought to be beneficial. More than this, don't those tyrants with the most power - and thus, the most ability to do what is beneficial to them - often make mistakes that end up hurting them? (Lee 19-)
