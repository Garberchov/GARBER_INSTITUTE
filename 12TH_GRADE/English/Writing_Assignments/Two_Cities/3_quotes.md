#### Quote 1
The character of Mr.Lorry is a foundational one for the story of "A Tale of Two Cities". He is the first character introduced in the story, is the lead in driving the plot forward to get Lucie to France and her father, Dr.Manette. From the portion of the book I have read thus far, one of the quotes that best summarizes Mr.Lorry's character is, "Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire." This quote is significant to the characterization of Mr.Lorry because it establishes him as more than just orderly and methodical, but rational and dependable. The watch itself is an excellent metaphor for the character of Mr.Lorry, and especially in comparison to his charge, Lucie. Lucie could well be described as "the levity and evanescense of the brisk fire" and Mr.Lorry as "the gravity and longevity", the fundamental grounding force that keeps the story moving forward. Mr.Lorry's fundamental importance is made clear by this quote, and an understanding of his character is made clear by the metaphor of the watch.
