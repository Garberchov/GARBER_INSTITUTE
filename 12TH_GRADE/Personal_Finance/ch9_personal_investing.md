#### 9.1: Types of Interest Rates and Investments

    - One of the most important uses of money is as a guarantee against the future. After all, chances are that you don't waste all your money on payday with no mind for how you're going to afford food until your next paycheck. However, putting money in a coffee jar or under the mattress is not the best way to hedge for the future. For one thing, what if the house burns down? Even if such tragedy doesn't strike, money is best put to work for an individual. When an individual puts money to work in hopes of making more money in the future, this is called an investment.
    - Important to clarify that in the more fun kind of economics, macroeconomics, investment refers to the purchase of goods that will be used to produce other goods. In personal finance, more in the realm of microeconomics, investment refers to the purchase of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate in hopes of making a profit. In a very meaningless sense these are the same thing, but in a more meaningful sense they are not.
    - Let's say that you were an investor interested in adding to your portfolio. You could just leave all your money as cash, but that has one big disadvantage. You don't get to take advantage of any growth opportunities. As a result, inflation slowly eats away at your money. To put this in perspective, the median home price in 1995 was around $150,000. By 2010, it was $300,000, and that's after a major fall in housing costs in 2007! Had you been saving for a house, simply putting money under a mattress would have resulted in you missing out. This erosion of the value of money is called inflation. Luckily, there are a number of investments that allow individuals to beat inflation and even make more money.
    - Open up any financial newspaper or magazine, and you are immediately hit with a wide variety of investment options. However, at their core, these boil down to two main classes: stocks and bonds. Stocks offer a share of the ownership of a company, whereas bonds are a way of loaning a company money in exchange for interest. Of the two, stocks have considerably more earnings potential, but bonds have much less risk. Throughout economics, and finance especially, you'll notice that the higher the earnings potential, the higher the risk.
    - Stocks make up the vast majority of investments, so let's say that you were interested in purchasing stock. In the past, you could choose between thousands of companies. Now, you can choose to own stock only in those companies or you can choose to buy funds that buy some, many or all of the stocks on the market. These range from mutual funds, which buy a preset ratio of pre-chosen stocks, or an exchange-traded fund, that is a basket of funds that can be traded like a stock. You can even buy an index fund that owns bits of every company that is traded on a given exchange.
    - Of course, there are other forms of investment that are available at your bank. For starters, you could put your money in a savings account. It would be relatively easy to get to but would pay very little in interest. The best interest rates nowadays are paid by the online banks, like SOFI or CIT Bank. They easily double the rates the mainline banks with branches are paying. They offer the same FDIC insurance too. On the other hand, a certificate of deposit, often called a CD, would allow someone to earn higher interest but they couldn't get to the money as easily. This is another golden rule of finances - the harder it is to get to one's money, the higher the rate of return is likely to be.
    - Interest rates(Jay Powell shoutout) are key in making your investment choices. When interest rates are low, low rates of return can be accepted as you will still have margin between your return and the inflation rate. When interest rates are high, you need to make sure that your investments are returning more than the inflation rate. This is why bonds are so popular when interest rates are high. They offer a fixed rate of return that is higher than the inflation rate.

#### 9.4: Financial Assets

    - Before we discuss different types of financial assets, let's make sure we understand what we mean when we say financial asset. To qualify as a financial asset, three important conditions must be met. It must be:
    	- Something you can own, Something of monetary value, That monetary value is derived from a contractual claim
    - So, financial assets are different than physical assets, like land or gold. With land and gold, you can touch and feel the actual physical asset, but with financial assets, you can only touch and feel something (usually a piece of paper) that represents the asset of value. The three financial assets we will discuss in this lesson are money, stocks and bonds.
    - Money is an official medium of exchange consisting of cash and coin defined by a government. Money, currency, cash, legal tender - they all mean the same thing. They are all a symbol of a central bank's commitment to sustain, as best they can, that money's value. Money is a financial asset because the value of the asset itself doesn't come from the paper or metal it is printed on; it comes from the faith and credit of the government that issued that money. This is obviously important because without a medium of exchange we would be looking for third and fourth means of exchange(I trade wheat for a cow, then trade the cow for a chicken, then trade the chicken for a pig, then trade the pig for a horse because that's all I really wanted in the first place). I am generally in favor of innovations in money(stablecoins like USDT due to far lower on-chain fees(0.003% vs 3% is a big increase in GDP), faster transaction times, and the wonderful nature of the leger.), but it is important to note that barter really sucks.
    - Another important financial asset in the U.S. economy is stock. Like money, stock is just a piece of paper that represents something of value. That 'something of value' represented by stock is an ownership stake in a business. Stock is also referred to as 'equity' because when you own stock in a company, you have equity in that company's profit. Almost any company can issue stock, such as owning a % fo a restaurant, but to sell it on an open exchange the rules are somewhat different. I wonder if there is an opportunity for restaurants to sell portions of stock + some kind of discount to investors, they would act as ambassadors. Could be cool. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I just come up with this stuff as I work, homeschooling is great.
    - The value of a share of stock depends on many factors. One share of stock in one company is not the same as one share of stock in another company. The number of shares each company has issued will impact the value of your share, as will the size and profitability of each company. Anything that may impact a business - good or bad - will change the value of stock.
    - Those are just very basic, fundamental factors that can impact the value of a share of stock. Macroeconomic trends impact individual stock prices, as well. Thousands of books have been written trying to figure out the golden rule that determines exactly what a share of stock is worth. The truth is that the value of a share of stock is determined by the market. The market is made up of millions of investors who are all trying to figure out what a share of stock is worth, and any gradient in difference produces arbitrage opportunities. That is why the price of a share fluctuates so wildly minute by minute but not so much over the long term. In addition, stocks with way less interest in them(low volume) can be manipulated by just a few investors. Volume is an underrated heuristic for new investors.

#### 9.5: Money Market Funds

    - A money market fund is an open-ended mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities. Money market funds are regarded as being as safe as bank deposits, yet they provide a higher yield. It is a type of fund that is required by law to invest in low-risk securities. These funds have low risks compared to other mutual funds and pay dividends that generally reflect short-term interest rates.
    - The main difference between money market funds and money market deposit accounts is that money market funds are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Although money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at a constant value of $1 per share, it is possible to lose money in a money market fund. Money market funds are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
    - Money market funds have the advantage of giving you the flexibility of a checking or savings account, but offer a better investment because of their higher interest rates. It's a relatively safe investment, but you still want to explore your options before putting money into any type of investment.
    - I generally hold a higher-yield preference, but for holding money market funds you know that over any period of time you won't come out worse which is better than a lot of other investments.
    - Money market funds typically invest in government securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper of companies, or other highly liquid and low-risk securities. Here are some examples of money market funds:
    - U.S. Treasury funds are one example. These offer lower yields than other types of money market funds, but also offer the lowest risk. If you have a low risk tolerance and don't mind the lower yield, these funds are for you. They are tax exempt.
    - Another example includes U.S. government and agency funds. These funds are a little riskier than a U.S. Treasury fund, with a slightly higher yield, but not much more. These funds invest in bonds and notes in the Federal government agencies, which are guaranteed by the Treasury and Congress. Some of these funds may invest in foreign securities, emerging market securities and mortgage-related securities. These funds are tax-exempt.
    - The reason that US bonds above other nations are so safe is that America has a giant economy, and the supercarriers to back it up. I am not a fan of deficit spending in general(goes against my minimalist government principles), but as a pure investment mechanism it is a good idea.

#### 9.6. Annuities

    - An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company in which you make a lump sum payment or series of payments and, in return, receive regular disbursements, beginning either immediately or at some point in the future. The goal of an annuity is to provide a steady stream of income during retirement. Annuities are often used as a means of securing a steady cash flow for an individual during their retirement years. They are also used to provide a steady cash flow for a person who has won the lottery or received a large settlement. There are two types of annuities: immediate and deferred. Immediate annuities begin paying out immediately after the lump sum is paid, while deferred annuities begin paying out at a future date. It is generally preferable to take the deferred to minimize your tax burden(boooo government).

#### 9.7: Mutual Funds

    - A mutual fund is an investment fund that is managed by an investment company. The fund raises money for its investment from shareholders, and is professionally managed and will typically utilize a diversified portfolio strategy often consisting of a variety of investments, including stocks, bonds, options and currencies, among others.
    - There are notable advantages to mutual funds. For one, they are managed by professionals who are paid to make the best investment decisions for the fund. This is a big advantage for the average investor who may not have the time or expertise to manage their own investments. Mutual funds also offer diversification, which is the practice of spreading your investments across a variety of asset classes to reduce risk.  Ub addutuibm they are liquid, meaning that you can buy and sell shares of the fund on any business day. This is a big advantage over other types of investments, like real estate, which can take a long time to sell and require some effort to manage.
    - The big hit against mutual funds is that they charge fees. These fees can be high, and they can eat into your returns. The fees are charged as a percentage of the assets under management, and they can be as high as 2% or more. If you are making 5% a year on your mutual fund investment, and they are charging 2%, you are only making 3% a year which is a dramatic hit to your potential compounded returns. This is why it is important to shop around and find a mutual fund with low fees. The fees are disclosed in the fund's prospectus, so make sure you read it before you invest.
    - An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is an investment product that is similar to a mutual fund. However, shares of exchange-traded funds are traded on an exchange, like a stock. You can think of ETFs as mutual funds that trade like stock. Exchange-traded funds try to match the same return as a particular market index. For example, the S&P 500 Index Fund invests in a portfolio of stocks in the Standards & Poor Index in an attempt to earn the same return as the index itself; if the S&P increases by 8%, the S&P Index Fund ideally will match it. There are also far smaller ETFs that focus on specific areas, there are marijuana industry ETFs, climate tech ETFs, I think a construction industry ETF also. If you are really knowledgeable about a space, investing in one you think will do well can be a good idea.

#### 9.8. Investing in stock and bonds

    - Most investors invest in publicly-traded securities, which are securities that are listed and traded on a securities exchange. A securities exchange is the marketplace where securities are traded that is maintained by some formal organization or group. Securities exchanges are operated all over the world. Some well-known exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, the London Exchange, the Tokyo Exchange and the Shanghai Exchange.
    - In the United States, companies that offer their securities for sale to the public must provide a prospectus, which discloses certain information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Smart investors carefully read the prospectus before investing in a company. The prospectus will provide information about the company's business, its financial condition, its management, and its prospects for the future. The prospectus will also provide information about the risks associated with investing in the company's securities.
    - Most investors will utilize a securities broker to facilitate the purchase and sale of securities. Securities brokers are professionals that must pass certain licensing exams and register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A broker is also subject to the rules and regulations of each exchange with which he conducts business.
    - A bond, sometimes called a debenture, is a debt instrument issued by a company or government entity to raise money. These are generally less expensive than stocks, but they also have less potential for growth. Bonds are considered a safer investment than stocks because they are backed by the issuer's ability to pay the interest and principal on the bond when it comes due, as well as the assets of the issuer. Still, it is generally riskier to buy company bonds than government bonds. Cities, states and other local governments will issue bonds, which are generally referred to as municipal bonds, which sometimes are exempt from taxes.

#### 9.9. Dividend Investing & Types

    - Stock is a type of security that represents ownership in a corporation. A shareholder can own one share of stock or many shares. The stock signifies a claim on a portion of the corporation's profits and assets. When a corporation earns profits, it can keep those earnings and reinvest the money in the corporation in order to promote growth. Many small or new companies reinvest profits.
    - Larger companies that can't find highly worthwhile investments in their own business to facilitate growth will often pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually in the form of cash or additional shares of stock. Dividends are paid out of the corporation's profits, and are usually paid on a quarterly basis. I am generally interested more in growth stocks than dividend stocks(I understand their motives and operations better), but a well placed dividend portfolio can be a great idea for those looking for decent yields with lower risk, it just takes a bit more time to research and manage.
    - Good example of dividend stocks: Walmart, Proctor & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and others.
    - Common stock is ordinary, everyday stock. The majority of stock is common stock. Common stock simply represents an ownership in the corporation and a claim to a portion of the corporation's profits. Common stock shareholders typically receive one vote per share at annual meetings. The corporation's board of directors is elected at these meetings. The board of directors represents the shareholders and oversees major corporation decisions. Common stock shareholders may also vote on other corporate issues, like stock splits.
    - Now let's turn to preferred stock. Preferred stock also represents a shareholder's ownership in a corporation. However, these shareholders are normally assured a fixed dividend distribution throughout the life of the corporation.

#### 9.10. EPS

    - Earnings per share, also known as EPS, is a very important number in business. It tells shareholders how much money each share of their stock earned for the company. It's important because, usually, when a company has a high earnings per share, it also has a high stock price, which makes investors happy.
    - The equation for it is Net Income - Preferred Dividents/Outstanding Common Shares.

#### 9.11. Indicators

    - An indicator is simply a statistic that can be used either to understand the current condition of the stock market or to predict where it is going.
    - Economic indicators are economic data that is used by investors to analyze the current condition of the economy to predict trends in the stock market. If the economy is healthy, that means it's growing and companies are making profits. On the other hand, if economic indicators show slowing economic growth, that may mean sales will slow and profits will go down. In fact, some companies may lose money or even go bankrupt. Gordon is sure to look at certain key economic indicators when each is released.
    - Inflation, employment, CPI, GDP and others are all important *macroeconomic* indicators that can affect the business cycle(and thus the stock market).
    - In addition, technical indicators which are based on a variety of mathematical formulas and graphing tools can be used to analyze price changes, trading volume, and other market data. Notably among these are the advance/decline index, which is a good way to see how the general market is moving. In addition, the absolutel breadth index gives a good window into overall market volatility, You can calculate it by subtracting the number of declining stocks from the number of advancing stocks. The absolute value of the resulting difference is an indication of market volatility. A large number means that the market is becoming more volatile, and a significant change in stock prices is probably coming.
    - The arms index is a short-term technical indicator that compares advancing stocks, declining stocks and trading volume to try and discern market sentiment. It is also referred to as a trading index, or TRIN. A value of less than 1.0 indicates that the market is bullish, while a value of greater than 1.0 is considered bearish. A bear is pessimistic about the stock market and believes the market is going down, while a bull is optimistic, believing the stock market is going up. A value of one indicates that the market is balanced.

#### 9.12. Real Estate

    - When Craig bought his first home, he had no idea that it would someday be worth five times its original value. But in a little less than seven years, it was worth a small fortune. That's when he got the idea to buy several other homes. Some of his real estate investments generated income as rental units, while others earned him a profit through price appreciation; that's when the price of the property increases over time.
    - There are several types of real estate investments: Residential, Commercial,Real estate investment trusts (REIT), Flips
    - Residential real estate is a property that is designed for individuals and families to live in and is generally used for rental income. The real estate investor becomes the landlord and leases his home out to a tenant, who pays a monthly rent to live there. This is a fairly safe investment because the rental units generate income each month. The rent money covers expenses and repairs, with some left over as a profit.
    - Some investors choose to own commercial real estate, like office buildings or large apartment complexes. The concept is similar to residential real estate in that the investor becomes the landlord, but instead of one private individual, the tenants are businesses or a large number of individuals. What attracts investors to this type of property is the profit margin. With multiple rents coming in each month, the investor stands to make more money by receiving rent payments from multiple tenants. Commercial real estate does cost more than a single family home or condo, but if we consider the economy of scale, this means the more units that are rented, the more money that flows in each month. In addition, owning something like an office building or a warehouse can be a good investment because the tenants are usually businesses that sign long-term leases. This means that the investor has a steady stream of income for a long period of time.
    - If you are not a hands-on investor and do not have the desire to actually manage a property, a real estate investment trust, or REIT, may be the right way to go. An REIT is a company that invests in commercial real estate and uses investor money to operate the properties. It is very much like owning stock in a publicly traded company. As an REIT owner, you are really an investor in a commercial real estate company and earn dividends as the REIT profits.
    - Flipping is another way to go. Flipping involves purchasing a house, usually below market value or even a foreclosure, making some renovations and reselling it for a profit. Sometimes the investor does the renovations himself to save money. On larger flips, the investor may put a contractor in charge of doing the work.

#### 9.13. ROI

    - The goal of it all.
    - Return on investment (ROI) is the ratio of a profit or loss made in a fiscal year expressed in terms of an investment. It is expressed in terms of a percentage of increase or decrease in the value of the investment during the year in question.
    - The basic ROI formula is: Net Profit / Total Investment * 100 = ROI. For example, if you bought a machine tool for your factory for $100,000 and it made you $30,000 in profit you wouldn't have had otherwise, your ROI would be 30%. This is a good way to measure the profitability of an investment.
    - Just 30% sounds like a terrible investment, until you realize that it doesn't go away after a year and you can keep making money off of it. This is why it is important to look at the long-term ROI of an investment(5 years, 10 years). If the machine tool is good to keep making you an extra $30,000 a year for 10 years, that's a 300% ROI. That's a great investment. In addition, for industrial purchases, you can write off the depreciation of the machine tool over time, which can be a significant tax advantage(add to the ROI).
