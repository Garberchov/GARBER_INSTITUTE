#### 3.1. Types of Taxes
 - Sales tax is a percentage levied by the state government on the sale of goods and services. The percentage varies by state. This money is used to fund a ton of random things that we mostly don't care--see "beauracracy" for more information--but some of it goes to roads, state parks, police, and other things that we do care about.
 - Payroll tax is a percentage levied by the federal government against personal income. Payroll tax is comprised of two types of taxes: Medicare and Social Security. Medicare is a tax that funds the Medicare program, which provides health insurance to people over the age of 65, as well as some younger people deemed eligible by the state. Social Security is a tax that funds the Social Security program, which provides retirement benefits to people over the age of 65, as well as some younger people deemed eligible by the state. Whether you choose to see these as banks that you're paying into or as a tax that you're paying to help others, they're still taxes. I lean more heavily towards the idea that taxes inevitably filter through such a complex system that you are only getting a fractional amount of what you put in, but that's just me.
 - Income tax also is a percentage levied by the federal government against personal income; however, the uses of income tax are different. Income tax is used for veteran's benefits, military, transportation, law enforcement, and much more. You can either decide to have it collected as part of your payroll(deduction) or do a lump sum payment at the end of the tax year. The amount of income tax you pay is determined by your income bracket, which is determined by how much money you make in a year. The more money you make, the higher your income bracket, and the more money you pay in taxes. This is called a progressive taxation system, and it's designed to make sure that the people who can afford to pay more in taxes do so. While in my view this is not a *just* system, it is an unjust necessity in our current political climate. Some kind of flat 15% sales tax on all sales save for food and housing would be a much more just system, but that's just me. Or a land value tax, for that matter, which would secondarily spur industrial growth due to smaller amounts of land speculation and an increase in the amount of land available for use. But I digress, this is not te place for discussion of such things.
 - Up next, because that wasn't enough money the government is going to inefficiently allocate, is the local personal property tax. This is a percentage levied by local government against the market value of personal and business property. While this sounds like a land-value tax, it's not. This is a tax on things like cars, boats, and homes - the market value(see subjective value) of items/things. A land-value tax is a tax upon land itself WITHOUT regard to the value of buildings, improvements, or personal property.
 - The capital gains tax is a percentage levied by the federal government against profit from investments. I.e. if you buy $100 worth of stock and it goes to $300, you pay a percentage of that $200 profit to the government. If you lost money, you can write off the loss against your income tax, which might equal out your other profit.
  

#### 3.2. The Federal Tax system
 - In summary, the Federal Tax System is massively complicated - that is why professionals exist to help you with it if you don't or can't do it yourself. The reasons behind this complication are numerous, but one of the most notable is the fact that HR Block and other companies that exist for this whole purpose lobbied congress to keep the tax code complicated. fun.
 - There are a series of graduated tax rates on your income as you get wealthier. From 10%, single filer up to $10,275 in 2002 to 37%(wowza) for over $539,900
 - The tax code is also full of deductions and credits that you can use to lower your tax bill. Some of these are for things like having children, going to college, or buying a house. Others are for things like donating to charity or investing in renewable energy. The idea behind these deductions and credits is to encourage people to do things that are good for society, like having children or investing in renewable energy. That we have imbued the government with the power to decide what is good for society is a whole other can of worms, but that's the way it is.
 - Once your taxes are preared you have to file them with the IRS by April 15th. First, an individual can simply mail his or her return and any other required documents to the IRS. The mailing address is dependent on one's state of residence, so it's important that an individual access the correct mailing address on the IRS website or on the back of their tax booklet.
 - Second, an individual or his or her tax preparer can submit the forms electronically via an approved IRS vendor. Sometimes this process is free, though certain vendors charge based on the type of return. Also, certain conditions might apply to file electronically. For example, if an individual is in bankruptcy, he or she might not be able to file electronically.
 - If an individual is owed a refund (that is they had an amount deducted that is more than they owe), they will receive it once the IRS processes the return. If the individual owes taxes, those should have been paid when the return was filed. If they weren't, the individual could incur hefty penalties and interest until the balance is paid. Why they don't just send a bill is beyond me.

#### 3.3. Progressive Tax Systems
 - I already know all about this, so I took the quiz and got a 5/5.

#### 3.4. Payroll Tax 
 - The payroll tax is a multitude of taxes that are paid by the employer and, in some cases, withheld from an employee's paycheck. The employer then remits these taxes to the appropriate tax authority.
 - There are numerous types of payroll taxes, including:
 - Federal income tax withholding, Social Security tax withholding, Medicare tax withholding, Additional Medicare tax withholding, State income tax withholding, Various local tax withholdings (city, county, school district)
 - Federal income tax withholding is withheld per IRS tables in publication 15T. When you are hired, you fill out a form called a W-4. This indicates to your employer how many dependents you wish to claim. The employer takes this information, along with your wages, and looks up in IRS publication 15T for how much in federal income taxes to withhold from your paycheck.
 - Combined, the Social Security tax withholding and Medicare tax withholding are known as FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act). In 2023, the tax responsibility for individuals is 7.65%, 6.20% for Social Security tax, and the remaining 1.45% is Medicare tax. The employer responsibility is also 7.65%, split similarly. However, the Social Security tax has a wage base limit, and in 2023, that limit was $160,200. So wages over $160,200 are not taxed with the Social Security tax in 2023. That is nearly 15% of your income for a program that you didn't actively choose to participate in. That's a lot of money...
 - The additional Medicare tax withholding is levied only on employees earning more than $200,000 for a single or head of household filer, and $250,000 for married filing jointly. This tax began in 2013, and is 0.9%, paid only by the employee.
 - State income tax withholding, if applicable (some states do not have a state income tax), is withheld in a similar manner as federal income tax withholding.
 - Various local tax withholdings, if applicable, are withheld if required by the local tax authorities. Examples of various local tax withholdings include city income taxes and school district income taxes.

#### 3.5. Income Tax Liability 
 - There are certian deducations that can decrease your income tax Liability. These include:
 - If you're paying back student loans, you can deduct a certain dollar amount of interest you paid over the last year. If you're still in school, you might be able to deduct some or all of your tuition and fees.
 - Home-based entrepreneurs have some relief too. If you own a home-based business, you can deduct your office space, travel, meals, and entertainment up to a certain dollar amount.
 - Do you invest in stocks or bonds? If you've made money, you will pay taxes on the gains. However, if you've lost money, you can deduct those losses up to a certain dollar amount. So if you are apprehensive about investing, go ahead and live a little with the comfort of knowing if you lose money, you can deduct it from your total income.
 - Some other deductions include business losses and certain retirement plans up to a specific amount. Once you subtract these deductions from your total income, you get your adjusted gross income, or AGI.
 - If you own a home, the IRS allows you to deduct the annual interest and property taxes that you pay to the mortgage company. At the end of the year, your mortgage company will send you a form that notes the total annual interest and property taxes paid. You simply enter these amounts on your tax form.
 - Although you might have health insurance, you can sometimes deduct unreimbursed medical and dental expenses, such as co-pays, medications, and travel for medical purposes. The total dollar amount needs to be more than a certain % of your taxable income to claim the deduction. For example, if your taxable income is $100,000, the unreimbursed expenses must be greater than 7.5%, or $7,500. The difference between the unreimbursed expenses and $7,500 is the allowable deduction. Gambling losses and charitable contributions can also be deducted.
 - Why gambling losses are deductible is beyond me. It's a voluntary activity that you choose to participate in. If you lose money, that's on you. If you win money, you have to pay taxes on it. That is pretty much how everything else works, but okay.
 - If you don't own a home, gamble, give to charity, or have unreimbursed medical expenses, you're still in luck. The IRS allows for a standard deduction, which is a specific dollar amount that you subtract from your adjusted gross income. The standard deduction is based on your age, as well as if you're a dependent, married, blind, or widowed. Before taking the standard deduction, it's important to total any itemized deductions to see if they're greater than the standard deduction, then take the larger of the two.

#### 3.6. Corporate Taxes 
 - Currently, corporations have a fixed tax rate of 21%. This is a flat tax rate, meaning that all corporations pay the same percentage of their profits in taxes. They also pay state and local taxes, which can vary depending on where the corporation is located, however this is less interesting to us.
