### Chapter 7: The Dark Ages

#### 7.1. Christianity
 - The early church began with small groups of followers meeting in homes. The news of Jesus was spread by word of mouth. The message was strengthened by the acts of these early believers - people who gave up worldly possessions, shared them with those in need, and cared for the sick. This spreading of the story and meaning behind Jesus' death brought Christianity to many Roman cities. Because of clashes with the Jewish and Roman authorities, many early church leaders were killed for their beliefs.
 - As Christianity continued to spread, bishops and other leaders began to be appointed. A key development was when Emperor Constantine I began to support Christianity in the early 4th century, legalizing Christian worship for the first time and actively encouraged the religion. He also convened the First Council of Nicaea, which was a gathering of Christian bishops. This was the first major standardization of the Christian belief system. It established the relationship between Jesus and God the Father, and decided on a date for Easter, among other things. The support of Constantine I and future leaders eventually led to Christianity becoming the Roman state religion in 380 CE, a decision which accelerated its growth even more and spread it to the edges of the Empire.
 - More than this, as it became part of the empire's political system it cemented its place as a part of all future political systems after the fall of Rome(in the West).

#### 7.2. The Loss of Classical Learning
 - Much of the learning of the Roman Empire was lost after its demise due to the lack of a common language - when Latin was the language of the whole empire, it was easy to spread knowledge. However, after the fall of Rome, the languages of the various Germanic tribes became the dominant languages in the West. This made it difficult to spread knowledge, as there was no common language. The only people who could read and write were the clergy, and they were more concerned with religious matters than secular ones. This led to a decline in literacy and the loss of much of the knowledge of the Roman Empire.
 - As well as this, the Church wanted to stamp out classical ideas that went against Christian beliefs.
 - This had signficiant impacts, as Europe went from the most advanced, literate place on the planet to a place where most people were illiterate and had no knowledge of the past.
 - Technological advancement ground to a total halt, and nothing really changed for hundreds of years.
