### Chapter 8 - The Early Middle Ages

#### 8.1. Feudalism and Charlemagne
 - Feudalism was a system of government/economics that was used in Europe during the Middle Ages(and in some places, even later). Fundamentally it was a system of obligations that bound lords and their subjects together in mutual obligation: the lord provided protection to his subjects(generally serfs), and in return the serfs provided labor and military service to the lord. Was this an optional system? No, it was not. The serfs were bound to the land, and could not leave without the lord's permission. Was this an equal system, once again no. Serfs had next-to-no rights, or leverage(with notable exceptions such as after plagues when labor was scarce or with peasant revolts) and were generally treated as property that came with the land.
 - Stepping into the feudal world of the Early Middle Ages, one character looms large: Charlemagne. He was the King of the Franks, what would later be known as France, he was a talented military commander, an able administrator(in respect to the time), and a devout Christian. He demolished the Lombards(Northern Italy), the Avars(Austria/Hungary), and the West German Saxons not already under his control. 
 - He also massacred something like 4,500 Saxons at Verden, and forced the survivors to be bapitzed into the Christian faith - these were ruthless measures, but they helped to ensure internal stability. 
 - For his eternal service to the Church and the office of the Papacy, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day, 800. This was a *huge* deal, as it established a divine right to rule for Kings(something that would be imitated by the Tsars, French Emperors, British Monarchs, and many, many others.)
 - Upon Charlemagne's death in 814, his empire, The Carolingian/Holy Roman Empire(the boundaries between the two are a bit fuzzy) was given to his son Louis the Pious. Eventually, the empire was split into three parts North-South, the middle kingdom which held Northern Italy, Southern France, Alsace-Lorraine, and the Low Countries could obviously not hold the twin borders, and was devoured by the other two kingdoms. Thus, what is now France and Germany were born(ish).
