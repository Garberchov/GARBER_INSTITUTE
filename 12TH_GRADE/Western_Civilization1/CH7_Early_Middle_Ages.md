### Chapter 8 - The Early Middle Ages

#### 8.1. Feudalism and Charlemagne
 - Feudalism was a system of government/economics that was used in Europe during the Middle Ages(and in some places, even later). Fundamentally it was a system of obligations that bound lords and their subjects together in mutual obligation: the lord provided protection to his subjects(generally serfs), and in return the serfs provided labor and military service to the lord. Was this an optional system? No, it was not. The serfs were bound to the land, and could not leave without the lord's permission. Was this an equal system, once again no. Serfs had next-to-no rights, or leverage(with notable exceptions such as after plagues when labor was scarce or with peasant revolts) and were generally treated as property that came with the land.
 - Stepping into the feudal world of the Early Middle Ages, one character looms large: Charlemagne. He was the King of the Franks, what would later be known as France, he was a talented military commander, an able administrator(in respect to the time), and a devout Christian. He demolished the Lombards(Northern Italy), the Avars(Austria/Hungary), and the West German Saxons not already under his control. 
 - He also massacred something like 4,500 Saxons at Verden, and forced the survivors to be bapitzed into the Christian faith - these were ruthless measures, but they helped to ensure internal stability. 
 - For his eternal service to the Church and the office of the Papacy, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day, 800. This was a *huge* deal, as it established a divine right to rule for Kings(something that would be imitated by the Tsars, French Emperors, British Monarchs, and many, many others.)
 - Upon Charlemagne's death in 814, his empire, The Carolingian/Holy Roman Empire(the boundaries between the two are a bit fuzzy) was given to his son Louis the Pious. Eventually, the empire was split into three parts North-South, the middle kingdom which held Northern Italy, Southern France, Alsace-Lorraine, and the Low Countries could obviously not hold the twin borders, and was devoured by the other two kingdoms. Thus, what is now France and Germany were born(ish).

#### 8.2. Charlemagne's Holy Roman Empire
 - *Insert quip about how the Holy Roman Empire was neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire*
 - In his position as Emperor, Charlemagne attempted to reinstate the cultural and political greatness of the Roman Empire - to mixed effect. Believing literacy could help in the process, he brought scholars to his realm to encourage education. Also, his rule saw the formation of monastic schools throughout the empire. With this emphasis on education, came a flowering of culture, known as the Carolingian Renaissance, a period of renewed emphasis on scholarship and learning. During this period the Carolingian minuscule, or a standardized form of writing, came into being. This form of writing would set the groundwork for the modern European printed alphabet, yet another success attributed to Charlemagne.
 - Also, nothing encapsulates this point more than the 11th century Song of Roland, an epic, yet rather fictional, poem highlighting the rule of Charlemagne. In it Charlemagne, the Holy Roman Emperor, was elevated to near god status, as a man beyond mortal wisdom. 

#### 8.3. Monasticism
 - Seeking to live within structure and severe self-discipline, monks have fervently pursued a continual awareness of the presence of God. Not only have they pursued this for themselves, they have often been responsible for reforming the Christian church, seeking to free it from the corruption power can bring. To grasp an understanding of monasticism, we're going to focus primarily on the Benedictine order of monasticism, tracing it from its inception to the Cluniac reforms. 
 - How well they have kept to their vows is frequently a matter of controversy, but the fact remains that they have been a powerful force in the history of the church.
 - It wasn't until around the middle of the 3rd century that the monasticism most of us think of when we hear the word 'monk' began to take shape. During this time, Egyptian Christians began pulling away from secular life, cutting themselves off from all and any human interaction. Perhaps one of the most famous of these hermit monks was St. Anthony. Tradition tells us he actually spent years in the land of Egypt during which time he never once came in contact with another human being. For these hermits, a life of complete detachment from the secular world was of extreme importance.
 - The father of western Monasticism is largely credited to Benedict of Nursia, he removed himself from the secular world in an attempt to remove the contamination of their sinful world. However, unlike many hermits, Benedict made the decision to re-enter society. Ironically, instead of living in solitude, he began attracting followers, who, within time, became a community of Christians who desired to live free from Earthly and fleshly desire. At their Earthly helm was Benedict of Nursia with a code of conduct of sorts, which came to be known as the Benedictine Rule. This rule, which came to be the guide for most monastic practices, held three things at its core. First, monks were to live a life of poverty. Second, monks were to live a life of chastity and celibacy. Third, monks were to submit to the authority of the monastic community. In order to maintain this life, Benedictine monks followed, and still follow, a strict life of scheduled prayer. 
 - The Benedictine order of monks was not free from corruption, as evidenced by the Cluniac reforms. The Cluniac Reform was a Benedictine movement founded by William the Pious, Duke of Aquitaine, around the year 910. This call for reform sought to rid the Church of the influence of secular rulers and authorities. Under their influence, the Church had begun practicing simony, or the selling of Church positions to the highest bidder. This was extremely problematic, because in effect, bishops and archbishops were becoming lords and nobles, raising troops and taxing the people.
 - Seeing this corruption, William the Pious and the monastery of Cluny refused to submit themselves to the authority of local lords. Instead, they would report directly to the Pope, while also demanding religious devotion from its members. Obviously, this didn't sit so well with the local lords on whose land the monastery sat. Nor did the feudal lords like being told their actions were, shall we say, less than 'Godly.' However, with the support of powerful Popes and church officials, the beliefs of Cluny spread. In fact, by the 12th century, over 1,000 monasteries were members of the Cluny congregation.

#### 8.4. Carolingian Art:
 - Now, empires are notoriously tricky things to administer in the best of times, and Europe in the 9th century was hardly the best of times. Charlemagne needed literate scribes to facilitate communication across the empire. Yet, literacy was all but nonexistent in Western Europe at the time.
 - To solve this problem, Charlemagne turned to the few literate people still left in the West: monks. He received the aid he required from some princes of the Church: Archbishop Egbert of Trier, Bishop Bernward of Hildesheim and Abbot Odo, who founded the Monastic order of Cluny. Yet, perhaps Charlemagne's greatest ally in the Church was Alcuin of York. With the help of the Church, Charlemagne established schools of literacy across his empire.
 - The art of illumination had been around for a few centuries and had reached new heights of complexity and beauty in Ireland, where Irish monks created intricate works like the Book of Kells. The Carolingians were not really innovators in this field, but what they used it for was far different - it was an instructional tool. The illustrations aren't there to inspire, but rather to help young scribes in training make sense of written Latin.
