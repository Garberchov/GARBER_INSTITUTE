### Chapter 9: The Warm Medieval Period

#### 9.1. The Medieval Warm Period
 - Between the years 1050 and 1300, Europe underwent an agricultural revolution. Crop yields multiplied by at least threefold. Europe's population followed suit, tripling in less than three centuries. The average European lifespan increased by as much as two decades.
 - After centuries of dormancy, merchants and artisans finally began to reappear. After the chaos and confusion following the fall of the Roman Empire, the medieval world was finally beginning to stabilize.
 - This stabilization was largely due to two factors, the first of which was a shift in climate which made Northern and Central Europe more hospitable to agriculture. The second was the end of the Viking raids, which had destabilized and terrorized Europe for centuries.
 - Around 950, Europe entered the Medieval Warm Period. Climatologists speculate that earth's temperature might have increased by as much as one degree centigrade. For about 300 years, Europe became a much warmer and dryer place. Why this happened is still pretty unclear, but it is speculated that it might have been due to a change in volcanic activity, or something causing a temporary(on planetary timescales) wobble in the earth's orbit. Whatever the cause, it was hugely helpful to Europe.
 - As the weather warmed, Viking invasions started to step down. Perhaps the Vikings were finally able to produce their own agricultural surpluses, and no longer felt the need to raid their neighbors in the south so often.
 - At the same time, centralized governments in Europe were becoming stronger, and a real sense of stability was returning to Europe for the first time since the collapse of the Roman Empire. In this period of relative peace, Europeans no longer needed to cluster around the local fortifications of their lords. They were finally able to disperse and settle new lands.
 - Aristocrats gave up their hunting grounds in the interest of generating profit from agricultural surpluses. Forests retreated as isolated pockets of agriculture spread until they at last met. The untamed woods of Northern Europe gave way to field after field, as far as the eye could see.
 - Critical to this agricultural boom was the introduction of the heavy plow, which was finally able to really break through the heavy clay that characterized so much of Northern Europe, the three-field system which allowed for a modicum of crop rotation, and the horse collar, which meant that beasts of burden were finally able to pull plows and carts without choking to death.

#### 9.2. The Great Schism
 - The Great Schism of 1054, also known as the 'East-West Schism,' divided Christianity, creating Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Although 1054 is the official date of this divide, tensions between the East and the West had been brewing for years. What finally broke the camel's back was the question of Papal Authority.
 - In around the year 330, Constantine moved the political capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Constantinople. From there, he managed to rule the entire empire. However, this was no easy task, and soon the empire broke down into Western and Eastern Empires, each with their own emperors. In fact, Theodosius, who died in 395 CE, was the last emperor to rule over both halves. Although the two halves seemed to be separated politically, the Christian Church still tried to maintain its power, though this wwas difficult due to poor communication.
 - The question of Papal Authority was simply whether the Pope had authority over Eastern Bishops. The Pope wanted to further his control over the entire Church, while the Eastern Bishops were willing to give the Pope simply honorary authority while maintaining autonomy. The East even went as far as calling their Bishop of Constantinople the ecumenical patriarch, meaning 'universal patriarch.' This was a direct challenge to the Pope's authority.
 - In 1054, the power struggle bubbled over when the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius, dared to condemn some of the religious practices of the Western Church. He even went as far as to close down Eastern churches that followed the same practices. The Pope and the Patriarch excommunicated each other, and the Great Schism officially began.
