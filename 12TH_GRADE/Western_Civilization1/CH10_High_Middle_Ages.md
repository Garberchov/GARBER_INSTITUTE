### Chapter 10: The High Middle Ages

#### 10.1. Heresy and Inquisition
 - Classical knowledge is knowledge of philosophy, science and astronomy in the ancient cultures around the Mediterranean Sea. Until the Middle Ages, classical knowledge was reserved for those who could read and write. This means that knowledge was heavily limited to the clergy and monks, who copied these texts to preserve them as treasures, but not to spread knowledge. As the population increased in Western Europe due to advances in technology and agriculture, there was a higher need for literate people to help keep records. Churches could no longer handle the growing need for education, and schools began to develop. Schoolmasters taught science and philosophy based on the classical manuscripts to many people. Students were encouraged to discuss this knowledge and exchange ideas. Although some scholars, like Thomas Aquinas, attempted to link classical philosophy with church doctrine, the spread of classical knowledge led to a deeper understanding of the church's place in society. There was a growing dislike of the church's power in secular matters, as well as the immense wealth and the corruption it created. 
 - Sometimes heretical beliefs became popular enough to see the formation of sects. One of these sects was known as the Cathars, or Albigensians. This group was popular in the 12th and 13th centuries in Italy and parts of southern France. Cathars were dualistic, meaning they believed in good and evil. They associated good with things that were spiritual and intangible, while they associated evil with things that were tangible. Cathars didn't acknowledge the sacraments performed by the Catholics, and didn't accept the physical birth and death of Jesus. They were very dissatisfied with the wealth of the Catholic Church and the large cathedrals they built. 
 - Pope Innocent III declared a crusade, or a holy war, against the Cathars in 1209 and succeeded in dissolving much of the group in France. Afterwards, the Inquisition occurred to root out any other Cathars and eliminate their practices. The Inquisition was the Catholic Church's weapon against heresy.

#### 10.2. The Spread of Ancient Knowledge
 - Aristotle is back on the menu!
 - Classical knowledge spread throughout Western Europe after the discovery of works of the ancient Greeks and Romans. During the Crusades, there was a large amount of people traveling to the East to join the movement. Classical manuscripts could be found in places like Armenia, Constantinople, Syria and Alexandria. Many manuscripts were obtained and brought back to Europe. Many intellectuals would hunt for these manuscripts and work to translate them from Greek into Latin, a language more well-known in Western Europe. As they worked to study ancient wisdom, they opened a door to modern learning.
 - In addition, as real schools/universities began to develop, the study of these texts grew outside of church cirles - analyzing them for their own sake instead of through religious lenses.
 - With the increasing literacy rates and growing accessibility to various types of texts, people were no longer left to be completely reliant on the church for answers. The pope would have felt immense pressure while he encouraged military campaigns for the Crusades and saw his power decline as knowledge spread throughout all social classes in Europe.
 - There was a growing sense of distrust among the people in regards to the church. Church clergy seemed to become corrupt while the church grew wealthier. Some dude named Martin is going to have some thoughts about this, but that's a later thing.
