 - ##### MAIN POINTS:
    - The precise date of invention, or even how it got to Europe is unknown, but it is believed to have been invented in China around the 9th or 10th century. It is quite possible that it was invented independently in Europe, the Middle East, and China, but the Chinese were the first to use it in warfare(signal rockets). 


#### Summary Session
- Modern warfare is very efficient; it allows a small number of people to kill or injure a large number of people in a short amount of time at relatively low risk to themselves. This can be put almost exclusively upon the invention of gunpowder as the revolutionary step that allowed not only warfare to progress to previously unimaginable levels of murderous efficiency but also for the development of modern industry and, in many ways, modern science and society.
