#### 4.1. Athenian Democracy
 - By the 6th century BCE, Athens was in major trouble - it was facing triplicate economic, social, and political crises. 
 - On the economic side, Athens was barely able to feed itself, and small farmers were going into ever greater debt.
 - On the social side, the only way for the poor farmer to get a loan was to put himself and his family down as collateral(a common practice until relatively recently), leading to ever greater numbers of debt-slaves.
 - On the political side, the aristocractic families were fighting amongst themselves for power instead of trying to actually form a working governmental system. At the time, Athens was run by 9 archons, elected for one-year terms(semi-similar to the later Roman Consuls) by a council of former archons. The archons used their positions to enrich themselves and their families, while doing little to actually improve Athens.
 - The solution to this came in the form of a man named Solon, who was elected to serve as a tyrant(similar to the later Roman Dictators who were elected in times of crisis, to act decisively, and then handed back their absolute power - Cincinnatus, for example). Solon set about solving the problems that plagued Athens immediately, including encouraging the planting of olives for olive oil exports, forbidding the export of foodstuffs abroad(though Adam Smith would object), and abolishing debt-slavery as an institution in Athens. He made it illegal for one Athenian to own another, and wiped the slate clean of all debts. He also reformed the political system, notably by changing the requirements for political power from lineage to wealth. This allowed wealthy, non-aristocrats to have a say in government(and was *more* meritocratic comparatively).
 - To ensure that the poor had a voice in politics as well, Solon expanded membership to the Athenian general assembly. He allowed all citizens of the realm to vote, whereas before the vote had been limited to the citizens of the city of Athens itself. He also gave the general assembly real power. He gave them the final decision of electing public officials and created a council of citizens to act as judges. 
 - This lasted only five years though, and while Solon's cousin Peisistratos was a fair ruler, his son, Hippias, was not.
 - In 510 BCE, Cleisthenes, the son of a prominent aristocrat and political leader, with the help of the Spartans, drove Hippias from Athens. Like Solon, Cleisthenes was more interested in reforming the system than in holding power. His program of reform and justice for the common people upset the aristocratic families. Under the leadership of Isagoras, the aristocrats drove Cleisthenes and his allies from the city, again with the aid of Spartans.
 - Isagoras had no interest in reforms, and Cleisthenes was unable to do anything about it(he couldn't really find any army just laying around to help him). With no nobility to save them, the people of Athens just revolted, executed the leaders of the coup, and brought Cleisthenes back to power. In doing so, they ushered in the worlds first democracy.
 - Cleisthenes broke the allegiance between a land's people and their aristocratic family by dividing Athenians into tribes, undoing the most significant powers of the aristocracy. 
 - With his new democratic state thus sheltered from the aristocracy, Cleisthenes placed the running of the state in the hands of the Athenian general assembly, in which every citizen, regardless of locale or wealth, had just one vote. The old positions of archon, as well as the old council of the Areopagus, were retained. Yet their power was greatly reduced. Proposal of measures, deliberation, even election of Archons was transferred to the general assembly. The old oligarchic Areopagus was left with little to do except offer advice and oversee trials for murder, treason and religion, though even then the final verdict lay with the assembly.

#### 4.2. Pericles, and the Athenian Golden Age
 - *Ring up Jordan McDeere, there is probably a television show to be bought **obscure reference**.*
 - After the second defeat of the Persians, all of Greece rejoiced. Together, they had overcome the mightiest empire the world had ever seen.
 - Fired up with Panhellenic pride, the Athenians spearheaded an alliance to take vengeance on the Persians. This alliance was called the Delian League. Islands and city-states across the Aegean built ships, armed crews and sent lavish donations to the League's treasury on the island of Delos. Always afraid of a slave revolt at home, Sparta declined to participate. Driving the Persians off was one thing, but picking a fight with them was quite another.
 - Yet the Spartans need not have feared. The superior triremes of the Greeks allowed them to attack with impunity. They sunk Persian ships and raided Persian towns. Worse yet, at least in the eyes of the Persians, the Greeks staged revolutions in the cities they conquered, killing off rich aristocrats and establishing democracies. Persian soldiers would arrive to reinforce a town only to find the gates barred to them while the Greeks had sailed on to attack somewhere else.
 - This naval dominance was a direct result of their maritime culture, as the lands of Greece were too rocky and too mountainous to support widespread agriculture, they had to import much of their food.
 - The Delian League grew rich off this plunder. Working together, they would teach the Persians never to mess with Greece again. Yet this giddy Panhellenism did not last forever. As the years stretched on, the members of the Delian League began to wonder if Persia had not been punished enough. The constant warfare was exhausting. People wanted to return to their normal lives.
 - But Athens would have none of it. As the head of the Delian League, Athens had become incredibly rich and powerful, establishing colonies and garrisons across the Aegean and Asia Minor. Moreover, the war was just the thing the young democracy needed to cement itself. As we've seen, political power usually came with military usefulness. With the offensive in Persia, suddenly all those poor citizens could make an important contribution to the war effort. They could row triremes, and in a month of rowing they could earn more than in a year of farming.
 - The other members of the League were less gung-ho about the whole arrangement. Yet they also did not want the angry Persians to be able to come back and take revenge. So, instead of providing ships and crews, they started just providing gold, food or raw materials and letting the Athenians take care of building and running the navy. And just like that, the states who had just fought for their freedom from Persia were now paying tribute to the Athenian empire.
 - While this doesn't sound great for the smaller states, it was objectively better than being under Persian rule, and to a certain degree insulated them from potential military disasters if a battle didn't go their way. Athens would take the brunt of the damage.
 - This fact was not lost on the Athenians, least of all on a leading statesman of the time, named Pericles. Pericles looked this bustle of activity, at all this wealth and all this power, and then he looked at the city of Athens. Athens had never been properly rebuilt after the last Persian invasion. The Athenians were too busy running their empire to bother with imperial trappings. Their grand temples were burned ruins, high atop the Acropolis for all to see. Their Great Assembly took place on a hill. This was no way for the seat of an empire to look; this was no way for things to be run. Someone needed to show the democratic Athenians how to be imperialists, and Pericles was the man for the job. 
 - The first thing Pericles did was to hold the Delian League together, by force of the Athenian navy. More or less, the Athenians had built a massive navy off of the tribute of the smaller states, and then decided to use that same Navy to say 'no' to the smaller states wanting out of the arrangement.
 - With the fiction of the Delian League out of the way, Pericles raided the treasury at Delos and brought it home to Athens. Now he had something to work with. Flush with cash from the treasury, Pericles rebuilt all the temples of Athens. To return beauty and grandeur to the Acropolis, he commissioned the Parthenon, with its huge golden statue of Athena. He also built a new meeting hall for the General Assembly as well as several other public buildings.
 - Pericles' enrichment of the Athenian state was not limited to building. He invited sculptors from around the empire to beautify the city. Meanwhile, he patronized a growing circle of philosophers, poets, playwrights and artists, giving rise to the glorious culture that came to be identified with all of Greece. For the next 2,000 years, Athens would remain a center of learning and art for the whole world.
 - Yet the art of Athens was not its greatest creation, it was its democracy. Pericles was one of the truest "democrats" of the ancient world, and under his leadership Athens shone like a beacon.
 - Yet this glorious democracy was paid for by the servitude of Athens' allies, and they would not tolerate it forever. One by one, members of the Delian League began to rebel. Terrified of Athens, they appealed to Athens' ancient rival, Sparta, for help. The result was the Peloponnesian War, which would strip Athens of its empire and power and bring its glorious experiment with radical democracy to an abrupt end.
