### Chapter 5: The Roman Republic

*My having listened to the entire *The History of Rome* podcast by Mike Duncan makes this chapter a bit of a review, but far more exciting.*

#### 5.1. Roman Myths and Religion
 - Roman religion was a mixture of Greek and Etruscan influence, as very little is actually original about Roman religion. 
 - Luckily for the Romans, they didn't have to go that far to get that influence. The Greeks had built a massive colonial presence in what is now southern Italy and Sicily, which they collectively referred to as Magna Graecia. This meant that there was plenty of first-rate Greek civilization occurring just a short journey away from Rome, and the Romans wanted in on it.
 - As a result, eventually the Romans had adopted a great deal of Greek religion. Of course, they updated it and put a Roman spin on it, all by changing the names of many of the gods, goddesses, and other figures. For example, Zeus - the Greek king of the gods - was now Jupiter, or even Jove, depending on what myth was being alluded to. Ares - the Greek god of war - was now Mars, but the Romans tended to view him in a more positive light. Heracles became Hercules.
 - To prove this, the Romans needed to look no further than one of their great national epics, The Aeneid. This work told the story of Aeneas, the ancestor of the mythical founder of Rome, Romulus. It turns out that Aeneas was himself Greek but was tasked with fate to found a civilization whose destiny was to rule the world. In this, the Romans acknowledged that the Greeks had been the first to worship that set of gods, but that it was sheer destiny for the Romans to worship them as well.
 - Other earlier influences became part of the Roman religious belief, especially from the Etruscans, a group that had lived where the Romans did and heavily influenced their culture. Notably, Rome had multiple gods of war. Of course there was Mars, who showed up in all the myths; but there was also Janus, a two-faced god who was believed to assist Roman armies on campaign. Also, there were the Vestal Virgins, who were loosely linked to the Greek Pantheon. The Vestal Virgins were a group of unmarried women who tended to the holy fire of Rome.

#### 5.2. Early Roman History
 - The Italian peninsula was already occupied by Etruscans in the north and Greeks in the south. We actually know very little about the Etruscans. We know that they didn't speak Latin or any of the other Indo-European languages that had spread from the Black Sea basin. This suggests that the Etruscans had been living in Italy since as early as 3-4,000 BCE. In the centuries that followed, the Etruscans made some neat architectural innovations, including the Arch.
 - The Greeks also inhabited the South, in what the Romans would later call "Magna Graecia", or "Greater Greece". It was a series of colonies that the Greeks had established largely for trade and farming.
 - Our main source for the history of these early Latins is the Roman historian Livy, whose work 'Ab urbe condita,' From the Founding of Rome, served as a textbook of Roman history for centuries.
 - No one is quite sure where the Latin invaders came from. The Romans claimed that their Latin ancestors emigrated from Troy, a far-off city on the coast of Asia Minor and scene of the famous Greek epic The Iliad. Historians do not take this claim very seriously. The general assumption is that the Roman link to Troy was an attempt to co-opt some of the glory of Greek civilization. It is much more likely that the Latins weren't civilized people from Asia Minor but rather barbarians from somewhere in Northern Europe(the irony that centuries later they would decry all Northern Barbarians was lost on them). Whatever their source, these people forced their way down into the Italian peninsula sometime between the first and second millennium BCE.
 - The Latins established cities from the Alps all the way down to Central Italy, violently displacing the native Etruscans. According to Livy, these Latin cities banded together for mutual protection, forming the Latin League. At the head of this league was the city of Latium, also known as Alba Longa. Latium was ruled by a series of kings who engaged in all of the normal scheming and political maneuvering one might expect from rulers.
 - According to Roman myth, one of these rulers, a fellow named Amulius, stole his brother's throne. Fearing his brother's daughter, Rhea Silvia, might produce an heir to challenge him, Amulius forced Rhea to become a vestal virgin. Despite the enforced chastity of her new position, Rhea became pregnant. Some said that Mars, the god of war, did the deed, but even Livy doesn't give this claim much weight. Rhea was cast into prison, and her twin sons, Romulus and Remus, were cast into the river. 
 - This is where the myth gets really interesting, because according to legend, Romulus and Remus were rescued from the river by a she-wolf, and raised by a shepherd. When they grew up, they killed Amulius and restored their grandfather to the throne of Latium. They were so confident in their victory that they immediately set out to found their own city. They found the perfect spot along the river Tiber and marked out its boundaries. All that remained was to give the city a name. Each of the brothers thought the city should be named after himself. Eventually the conflict came to blows, and Romulus slew his brother Remus, giving the city its new name: Rome. Livy gives the date of this founding as 753 BCE, a date that even modern historians seem to agree with.
 - This is when the legend becomes darker, as the original inhabitants of Rome were an *unsavory cast* - mostly poor farmers and men on the run from other cities. Thus, not enough women would marry a Roman man. The solution to this: steal a bunch of women from nearby towns. It has been immortalized in paintings literally entitled *The Rape of the Sabine Women* by Peter Paul Rubens, and many other besides. Thus, the original unsavory reputation of Rome was made all the more unsavory.

#### 5.3. The Seven Kings of Rome
 - Rome is viewed in the modern lens either as a republic, or an empire, but few know that before there was ever a Roman Republic there was the Kingdom of Rome. The first seven kings of Rome are largely legendary, as it is easy to point to any of them and say *This one is the reason we have this religion", or "This one is the reason we have this institution", but it is definitely true that the Rome *had* kings before it had a republic.
 - According to Roman legend, the first king of Rome was Romulus, who founded the city and gave it its name. We're not sure if Romulus was a real person or just a figure of legend, but he certainly seems to have been a rather enlightened leader for his time. Romulus did not establish an absolute monarchy in which the king controlled every aspect of the state. Nor did he set up a dynastic monarchy in which princes succeeded their fathers to the throne. Instead, Romulus set up a sort of limited monarchy in which the power of the king is checked by other government bodies. He established a council of founding fathers known as the Senate. The Senate was mostly advisory in function. The only real power Romulus granted the Senate was the power to elect future kings. He probably got this idea from the Etruscans, who used a similar system to elect their own kings.
 - More than this, the King served as both the combination of all secular and non-secular power - both the controller of all military/political and an intermediary between the gods and man.
 - After the death of Romulus, we get Numa - once again, it is unclear whether he was a real person but he is one of those kings that the Romans could attribute things to - in his case, Religion. 
 - After Numa, we get Tullus - who probably was a real person - and he is the one who gets credited with Rome's military prowess and military tradition.
 - After Tullus, we get Ancus Marcius - who was also probably a real person, and is apparently Numa's grandson - and he is credited with Rome's expansion and the founding of the port city of Ostia.
 - The last of the elected Kings was Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, more commonly known as Tarquin the Elder, who was not actually a Roman by birth by an Etruscan immigrant. According to the legend/history, Ancus Marius was so impressed with the competence of Tarquin that he appointed him the caretaker/regent for his children. Upon the death of Ancus Marius, he was in a fine position to declare his candidacy for King and was duly elevated. He was seen by the later Romans as perhaps the most impressive(save for Romulus) of their kings, and his military prowess was legendary - going after the Latins, Sabines, and Etruscans.
 - The death of Tarquinius Priscus marked the end of the legitimate kingship in Rome. Tarquinius Priscus was not succeeded by an elected king but rather by his son-in-law, Servius Tullius, who ruled from 578 BCE to 535 BCE. Despite his unusual path to power, Servius was remembered fondly by the Romans, who attributed many important parts of their society to him. Servius supposedly tried to decrease the power of the aristocracy and grant greater power to the common people. He came up with a new class system that extended the vote to a much larger portion of the Roman population, and changed voting rights to align with people's place of residence rather than their lineage. He also replaced the aristocratic comitia curiata with the more inclusive comitia centuriata.
 - Yet, Servius still took efforts to maintain the authority of the aristocracy by making sure that the few votes of the rich could always outweigh the many votes of the poor. These reforms had a military aspect as well, since the divisions of classes determined a person's military obligation to the state.
 - The last king of Rome was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, or Tarquin the Proud, the grandson of Tarquin the Elder. Tarquin the Proud's reign included some great military feats, some failures, and a *lot* of tyranny(according to the Legend/History). He killed his predecessor to seize the throne, killed a lot of senators who opposed him, and took a lot of wealth from pillaging for *himself* instead of the troops/state - which is never a smart move.
 - He tried to pull the same move that Commodus would later attempt - buying the masses adoration through games and festivals - but when the money ran out, he had to keep conquering to try and keep paying for it. When the campaign went poorly, Tarquin the Proud's son Sextus raped a noblewoman named Lucretia. Lucretia was so ashamed that she killed herself, but not before telling her husband and father what had happened. They were so enraged that they led a rebellion against Tarquin the Proud, and the Roman people rose up against him. Tarquin the Proud was thrown out of Rome by the people, led by Lucretia's widowed husband, Lucius Junius Brutus - whose descendant would later be the one to kill Julius Caesar(a family with an anti-tyranny streak, it appears).
