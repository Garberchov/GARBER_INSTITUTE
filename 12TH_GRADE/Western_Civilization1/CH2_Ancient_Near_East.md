#### 2.1. The Invetnion of Writing
 - Writing was invented somewhere between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia. They were written into soft clay, which was then baked in the sun. Small cymbols, called Cuneiform, were used to represent words, syllables, or objects.
 - The greatest benefit was the ability for societies to keep records. This allowed for a beauracracy to form, and for the first time, a government could keep track of its citizens. While some today might see this as a negative, it was a huge step forward for civilization. It allowed for the creation of laws, and the ability to enforce them. More than that, it allowed for efficiencies to compound, further increasing the surplus of food and goods.


#### 2.2. The Invention of Money
 - This is an extremely simplified version of an extremely complex topic.
 - In the era before money, barter was the only means of exchange. This was extremely inefficient, as it required a double coincide of wants. In non-economics-nerd speak, it means that if I have fish and want clothes, and you have clothes but don't want fish, we can't trade. However, with the use of a universal medium of exchange, we can trade. This is the purpose of money.
 - For a long time, the medium of exchange was gold, silver or other precious metals. However on the Island of Yap, they used large stones as money. The stones were so large that they were immobile, and so they were never moved. Instead, the ownership of the stone was transferred. This is a great example of how money is a social construct. It is only valuable because we all agree that it is valuable. 
 - Unitl recently though, the size of an economy was limited by the amount of gold in the world. This is because the amount of money in an economy was limited by the amount of gold. However, with the invention of paper money, this is no longer the case. Now, the amount of money in an economy is limited by the amount of paper money in the economy. This is why inflation is a thing. The more money there is, the less valuable it is. This is why the US dollar is worth less than it was 100 years ago. However the benefits of haivng a non-fixed money supply are huge. It allows for the economy to grow much faster than it would otherwise.
