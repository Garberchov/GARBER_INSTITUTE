#### 2.1. The Invention of Writing
 - Writing was invented somewhere between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia. They were written into soft clay, which was then baked in the sun. Small symbols, called Cuneiform, were used to represent words, syllables, or objects.
 - The greatest benefit was the ability for societies to keep records. This allowed for a bureaucracy to form, and for the first time, a government could keep track of its citizens. While some today might see this as a negative, it was a huge step forward for civilization. It allowed for the creation of laws, and the ability to enforce them. More than that, it allowed for efficiencies to compound, further increasing the surplus of food and goods.


#### 2.2. The Invention of Money
 - This is an extremely simplified version of an extremely complex topic.
 - In the era before money, barter was the only means of exchange. This was extremely inefficient, as it required a double coincide of wants. In non-economics-nerd speak, it means that if I have fish and want clothes, and you have clothes but don't want fish, we can't trade. However, with the use of a universal medium of exchange, we can trade. This is the purpose of money.
 - For a long time, the medium of exchange was gold, silver or other precious metals. However on the Island of Yap, they used large stones as money. The stones were so large that they were immobile, and so they were never moved. Instead, the ownership of the stone was transferred. This is a great example of how money is a social construct. It is only valuable because we all agree that it is valuable. 
 - Until recently though, the size of an economy was limited by the amount of gold in the world. This is because the amount of money in an economy was limited by the amount of gold. However, with the invention of paper money, this is no longer the case. Now, the amount of money in an economy is limited by the amount of paper money in the economy. This is why inflation is a thing. The more money there is, the less valuable it is. This is why the US dollar is worth less than it was 100 years ago. However, the benefits of having a non-fixed money supply are huge. It allows for the economy to grow much faster than it would otherwise.

#### 2.3. Development of Religion
 - Mother Goddesses were the first deities. They were associated with fertility, and were worshiped by the first civilizations. This has led to speculation that the first civilizations were matriarchal, but there is limited evidence to support any theory.
 - The first male gods were associated with 'destructive' things - volcanoes, the sea, etc. Men were associated with violence, and thus the gods associated with violent things were seen as being inherently male.

#### 2.4. The Fertile Crescent
 - The Fertile Crescent is roughly an area from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. It is the area where the first civilizations developed. 
 - The two main rivers in the Fertile Crescent are the Tigris and Euphrates, and together they form an area called Mesopotamia. 
 - The Mesopotamian civilizations were the first(or first we know of) to develop a system of totally sedentary agriculture. They built complex(for the time) irrigation systems, and were able to produce a reliable surplus of food.
 - As previously discussed, this allowed for the development of a bureaucracy to manage the surplus, and the development of a government to enforce the laws.

#### 2.5. Sumerian Art and Architecture
 - We get some of the first non-cuneiform art from Ur. The city may have been founded by the Ubaids, who preceded the Sumerians in inhabiting the area. Ur became so powerful that it held control over all of Sumer at varying times. The Standard of Ur is an artifact that was found in an excavation at Ur. It consists of a number of wooden fragments containing vivid mosaics. 
 - Another artifact from Ur is a ziggurat, a kind of stepped-pyramid. It was a temple to the moon god Nanna.

#### 2.7. Heirs of the Sumerians
 - The growth of Babylon as the successor to Ur was due to Hammurabi, the first to unite all of Mesopotamia under one ruler since Ur. Hammurabi inherited a central, but rather unimportant kingdom of Mesopotamia. He led a well-disciplined fighting force to the conquest of his Amorite rivals, Isin and Larsa, as well as the already ancient cities of Ur and Uruk. By the time he was done, Babylon would be the seat of an empire stretching for thousands of miles. But Hammurabi was not sated with mere conquest.
 - However, he didn't want an empire held together by continual force, so he created a code of laws. The code was based on the principle of lex talionis, or "an eye for an eye". The code was written on a stone pillar, and placed in the center of Babylon. It was written in cuneiform, and was the first time that a law code had been written down. It was also the first time that a law code had been made public.
 - The Babylonians would continue to be the major power in the region until around 1600 BCE, when the Hittiies would sack the city - they were experts in the use of chariots and cavalry warfare generally, and had superior metalworking to aid their weaponry. However they had no interest in genuine conquest, and so they left Babylon to its own devices with their plunder.
 - The Hurrians filled this power vacuum in part of Mesopotamia, but the Assyrians would be the first to fully reclaim the mantle of the true rulers of the region. Where the Babylonians had been farmers and merchants ruled by priests, the Assyrians were first and foremost warriors. While their kings might have traced their descent from the city's patron deity, Ashur, it was in essence a military aristocracy.
 - The Kassite Babylonians tried to reclaim the full glory of the Babylonian empire, but they were never able to fully do so. Thus, a tri-party power struggle between the Kassite Babylonians, the Assyrians, and the Hittites would continue for centuries. 
 - This power struggle ended with the [Bronze Age Collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMP328eU5Q). The "Sea People" were a group of raiders, unknown to us today, who raided up and down the Mediterranean coast. This kicked off a wave of destabilization which would lead to the total collapse of the Hittites, and the total severing of trade routes. 

#### 2.8. Assyrian Art and Architecture
 - Due to the expansive size of their empire, the Assyrians gained access to many resources including stone and iron. The popularity of iron tools led to the creation of massive palaces. Although the availability of stone was ample, Assyrians chose to use mud brick to build many of their palaces in order to emulate the Sumerians. This was a common theme for the successors of the Sumerians.
 - One of the unique characteristics of Assyrian art is their relief carvings. They created elaborate relief carvings in stone which exhibited very extensive detail. The carvings often held images of battles and major events of war. These carvings also held depictions of the violent results of battle. This may even be the earliest form of narrative art, or art that tells a story. 
 - One example of detailed Assyrian carvings is the lamassu. The lamassu was a winged lion or bull with the head of a human. Lamassu were carved into the entrance of the palace. They were intended to ward off evil, looming over foreign ambassadors and allies. 

#### 2.9. Hammurabi's Code
 - The need for laws to govern a society is inherent in the human condition, as without them our rational(or irrational) self-interest will lead to chaos.
 - Hammurabi's code was not the first set of laws, but it was the first to be truly modern. Inscribed on a stone steele, it contained 282 laws. Some of these laws were draconian to modern eyes, but a formalized system of laws and justice was a huge step forward for civilization.

#### 2.11. The Hebrews
 - The Hebrew religion, known today as Judaism, is one of the oldest religions on Earth, with a written history stretching back over 3,000 years. Though some ancient religions predate Judaism, few of them survived to the modern age, and only Hinduism can cite a longer, continuous written history.
 - Unlike many religions at the time of its founding, Judaism is monotheistic. 
 - More than that, Judaism is both religious and ethnic. 
 - Perhaps the most important factor in the continued persistence of Judaism, is that it has a holy text to preserve beliefs, traditions, laws, and history.
 - The Jewish holy text, or Tanakh, is not a single book, but rather a collection of books written over a thousand years.
 - Jews divide the books of the Tanakh into three groups: The Torah, The Nevi'im and the Ketuvim. The foremost of these is the Torah.
 - the Hebrews thought the universe was created through words. God created the world by speaking it into existence. He said, 'Let there be light', and there was light. This establishes the importance of words in the Jewish faith, a theme that recurs time and time again.
 - God also created the first man and the first woman, Adam and Eve. God put Adam and Eve in a beautiful paradise where their every need was taken care of. His only rule was that they should not eat a certain fruit. Eve was tempted to eat this fruit, and Eve tempted Adam to eat the fruit, and God got mad, and the two were cast out of paradise.
 - This establishes a pattern that will repeat time and time again in the Torah: God gives a commandment to man. Man disobeys, usually through temptation of the flesh. God punishes man.
 - Another trend that we see in the Jewish faith is God's selection of a chosen person. The God of the Torah seems generally disgusted with the world, but he occasionally finds someone who is faithful. Yet, being God's chosen one involves a lot of work and a lifetime of obedience. God's gifts are not free. He requires sacrifice on the part of his believers.
 - Between the books of the Nevi'im and the efforts of modern archaeologists, we know that the Hebrews fell under the control of many empires over the years, including the Babylonians, Assyrians, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians and Romans. Some of these conquerors were quite intent on wiping out the Hebrew people and their faith. Both the Assyrians and Babylonians made a practice of relocating conquered peoples from their homelands into somewhere deep within the empire. (It was a free way to gain a lot of skilled population, it was a practice that Khorasu Anushirawan would later use to great effect, and something that the Romans generally failed at.)


#### Ancient Egypt
 - At the heart of Egyptian civilization lies the Nile. All of Egypt lies along the banks of the Nile. To the east and west lay only barren desert, impassable for armies of the time. Thus, Egypt had but two fronts to defend: the mouth of the Nile at the Mediterranean to the north and the upper reaches of the Nile valley to the south. Compare this to Mesopotamian culture, which was in danger of invasion from all directions. The natural protection of the Nile valley allowed Egyptian civilization to avoid the constant incursions that destroyed so many Mesopotamian cultures.
 - The Nile is also very different from the Tigris and Euphrates that fed Mesopotamian civilization. Where the Tigris and Euphrates flood chaotically, the Nile floods in a regular, predictable fashion. This predictability had two main results. First, it makes it much easier to plant and harvest according to a regular time table, allowing for reliable and bountiful harvests. Second, the predictability of the Nile allowed for central planning of agriculture to be very successful. This bolstered the credibility and power of centralized authority.
 - Along the Nile, there grows a plant that grows nowhere else in the world, papyrus. As early as 3000 BCE, the Egyptians had discovered that the pith of this thin, reedy plant could be spread, flattened and dried to make a rudimentary sort of paper. While the Sumerians were busy poking sticks in clay tablets for millennia, the Egyptians were already using scrolls of papyrus to write. Records on Papyrus were lighter, easier to store and easier to make than clay tablets. This superior writing surface also allowed the Egyptians to retain their pictographic hieroglyphics long after the Sumerians had reduced their pictographs to the more abstract and standardized cuneiform. The superiority of papyrus was eventually recognized by the ancient world, and Egypt grew rich indeed on the export of paper.
 - In the Archaic Period, the First and Second Dynasties unified the Nile Valley to build the first Egyptian tate. They also centralized Egyptian religion through syncretism, as it allowed them to unify the various local gods into a single pantheon.
 - In the Old Kingdom, the Pharaohs of the Third through Sixth Dynasty reached the peak of their power and influence. The Pharaohs were worshipped as gods, and as such, built the pyramids as tombs to themselves.
 - In the First Intermediate Period, the Pharaohs decline dramatically in power and were engaged in a century and a half of civil war.
 - During the Middle Kingdom, the two regional dynasties struggled to reunify Egypt.
 - The Second Intermediate Period was a time of foreign rule, after the Hyskos conquered Northern Egypt and it took five dynasties to drive them out.
 - The New Kingdom was the second, and probably greater, peak of Egyptian power. They conquered along the Eastern Mediteranean coast, and even conquered mcuh of the Levant. However, they were stopped by the Hittites. Eventually Egypt would also fall to the Bronze age collapse, surviving as a husk only until Alexander The Great conquered it, and the Ptolemaic dynasty was established, which would last until the Roman conquest of Egypt.
