### Chapter 2: Ancient Near East

#### 2.1. The Invention of Writing
 - Writing was invented somewhere between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia. They were written into soft clay, which was then baked in the sun. Small symbols, called Cuneiform, were used to represent words, syllables, or objects.
 - The greatest benefit was the ability for societies to keep records. This allowed for a bureaucracy to form, and for the first time, a government could keep track of its citizens. While some today might see this as a negative, it was a huge step forward for civilization. It allowed for the creation of laws, and the ability to enforce them. More than that, it allowed for efficiencies to compound, further increasing the surplus of food and goods.


#### 2.2. The Invention of Money
 - This is an extremely simplified version of an extremely complex topic.
 - In the era before money, barter was the only means of exchange. This was extremely inefficient, as it required a double coincide of wants. In non-economics-nerd speak, it means that if I have fish and want clothes, and you have clothes but don't want fish, we can't trade. However, with the use of a universal medium of exchange, we can trade. This is the purpose of money.
 - For a long time, the medium of exchange was gold, silver or other precious metals. However on the Island of Yap, they used large stones as money. The stones were so large that they were immobile, and so they were never moved. Instead, the ownership of the stone was transferred. This is a great example of how money is a social construct. It is only valuable because we all agree that it is valuable. 
 - Until recently though, the size of an economy was limited by the amount of gold in the world. This is because the amount of money in an economy was limited by the amount of gold. However, with the invention of paper money, this is no longer the case. Now, the amount of money in an economy is limited by the amount of paper money in the economy. This is why inflation is a thing. The more money there is, the less valuable it is. This is why the US dollar is worth less than it was 100 years ago. However, the benefits of having a non-fixed money supply are huge. It allows for the economy to grow much faster than it would otherwise.

#### 2.3. Development of Religion
 - Mother Goddesses were the first deities. They were associated with fertility, and were worshiped by the first civilizations. This has led to speculation that the first civilizations were matriarchal, but there is limited evidence to support any theory.
 - The first male gods were associated with 'destructive' things - volcanoes, the sea, etc. Men were associated with violence, and thus the gods associated with violent things were seen as being inherently male.

#### 2.4. The Fertile Crescent
 - The Fertile Crescent is roughly an area from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. It is the area where the first civilizations developed. 
 - The two main rivers in the Fertile Crescent are the Tigris and Euphrates, and together they form an area called Mesopotamia. 
 - The Mesopotamian civilizations were the first(or first we know of) to develop a system of totally sedentary agriculture. They built complex(for the time) irrigation systems, and were able to produce a reliable surplus of food.
 - As previously discussed, this allowed for the development of a bureaucracy to manage the surplus, and the development of a government to enforce the laws.

#### 2.5. Sumerian Art and Architecture
 - We get some of the first non-cuneiform art from Ur. The city may have been founded by the Ubaids, who preceded the Sumerians in inhabiting the area. Ur became so powerful that it held control over all of Sumer at varying times. The Standard of Ur is an artifact that was found in an excavation at Ur. It consists of a number of wooden fragments containing vivid mosaics. 
 - Another artifact from Ur is a ziggurat, a kind of stepped-pyramid. It was a temple to the moon god Nanna.

#### 2.7. Heirs of the Sumerians
 - The growth of Babylon as the successor to Ur was due to Hammurabi, the first to unite all of Mesopotamia under one ruler since Ur. Hammurabi inherited a central, but rather unimportant kingdom of Mesopotamia. He led a well-disciplined fighting force to the conquest of his Amorite rivals, Isin and Larsa, as well as the already ancient cities of Ur and Uruk. By the time he was done, Babylon would be the seat of an empire stretching for thousands of miles. But Hammurabi was not sated with mere conquest.
 - However, he didn't want an empire held together by continual force, so he created a code of laws. The code was based on the principle of lex talionis, or "an eye for an eye". The code was written on a stone pillar, and placed in the center of Babylon. It was written in cuneiform, and was the first time that a law code had been written down. It was also the first time that a law code had been made public.
 - The Babylonians would continue to be the major power in the region until around 1600 BCE, when the Hittiies would sack the city - they were experts in the use of chariots and cavalry warfare generally, and had superior metalworking to aid their weaponry. However they had no interest in genuine conquest, and so they left Babylon to its own devices with their plunder.
 - The Hurrians filled this power vacuum in part of Mesopotamia, but the Assyrians would be the first to fully reclaim the mantle of the true rulers of the region. Where the Babylonians had been farmers and merchants ruled by priests, the Assyrians were first and foremost warriors. While their kings might have traced their descent from the city's patron deity, Ashur, it was in essence a military aristocracy.
 - The Kassite Babylonians tried to reclaim the full glory of the Babylonian empire, but they were never able to fully do so. Thus, a tri-party power struggle between the Kassite Babylonians, the Assyrians, and the Hittites would continue for centuries. 
 - This power struggle ended with the [Bronze Age Collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMP328eU5Q). The "Sea People" were a group of raiders, unknown to us today, who raided up and down the Mediterranean coast. This kicked off a wave of destabilization which would lead to the total collapse of the Hittites, and the total severing of trade routes. 

#### 2.8. Assyrian Art and Architecture
 - Due to the expansive size of their empire, the Assyrians gained access to many resources including stone and iron. The popularity of iron tools led to the creation of massive palaces. Although the availability of stone was ample, Assyrians chose to use mud brick to build many of their palaces in order to emulate the Sumerians. This was a common theme for the successors of the Sumerians.
 - One of the unique characteristics of Assyrian art is their relief carvings. They created elaborate relief carvings in stone which exhibited very extensive detail. The carvings often held images of battles and major events of war. These carvings also held depictions of the violent results of battle. This may even be the earliest form of narrative art, or art that tells a story. 
 - One example of detailed Assyrian carvings is the lamassu. The lamassu was a winged lion or bull with the head of a human. Lamassu were carved into the entrance of the palace. They were intended to ward off evil, looming over foreign ambassadors and allies. 

#### 2.9. Hammurabi's Code
 - The need for laws to govern a society is inherent in the human condition, as without them our rational(or irrational) self-interest will lead to chaos.
 - Hammurabi's code was not the first set of laws, but it was the first to be truly modern. Inscribed on a stone steele, it contained 282 laws. Some of these laws were draconian to modern eyes, but a formalized system of laws and justice was a huge step forward for civilization.

#### 2.11. The Hebrews
 - The Hebrew religion, known today as Judaism, is one of the oldest religions on Earth, with a written history stretching back over 3,000 years. Though some ancient religions predate Judaism, few of them survived to the modern age, and only Hinduism can cite a longer, continuous written history.
 - Unlike many religions at the time of its founding, Judaism is monotheistic. 
 - More than that, Judaism is both religious and ethnic. 
 - Perhaps the most important factor in the continued persistence of Judaism, is that it has a holy text to preserve beliefs, traditions, laws, and history.
 - The Jewish holy text, or Tanakh, is not a single book, but rather a collection of books written over a thousand years.
 - Jews divide the books of the Tanakh into three groups: The Torah, The Nevi'im and the Ketuvim. The foremost of these is the Torah.
 - the Hebrews thought the universe was created through words. God created the world by speaking it into existence. He said, 'Let there be light', and there was light. This establishes the importance of words in the Jewish faith, a theme that recurs time and time again.
 - God also created the first man and the first woman, Adam and Eve. God put Adam and Eve in a beautiful paradise where their every need was taken care of. His only rule was that they should not eat a certain fruit. Eve was tempted to eat this fruit, and Eve tempted Adam to eat the fruit, and God got mad, and the two were cast out of paradise.
 - This establishes a pattern that will repeat time and time again in the Torah: God gives a commandment to man. Man disobeys, usually through temptation of the flesh. God punishes man.
 - Another trend that we see in the Jewish faith is God's selection of a chosen person. The God of the Torah seems generally disgusted with the world, but he occasionally finds someone who is faithful. Yet, being God's chosen one involves a lot of work and a lifetime of obedience. God's gifts are not free. He requires sacrifice on the part of his believers.
 - Between the books of the Nevi'im and the efforts of modern archaeologists, we know that the Hebrews fell under the control of many empires over the years, including the Babylonians, Assyrians, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians and Romans. Some of these conquerors were quite intent on wiping out the Hebrew people and their faith. Both the Assyrians and Babylonians made a practice of relocating conquered peoples from their homelands into somewhere deep within the empire. (It was a free way to gain a lot of skilled population, it was a practice that Khorasu Anushirawan would later use to great effect, and something that the Romans generally failed at.)


#### Ancient Egypt
 - At the heart of Egyptian civilization lies the Nile. All of Egypt lies along the banks of the Nile. To the east and west lay only barren desert, impassable for armies of the time. Thus, Egypt had but two fronts to defend: the mouth of the Nile at the Mediterranean to the north and the upper reaches of the Nile valley to the south. Compare this to Mesopotamian culture, which was in danger of invasion from all directions. The natural protection of the Nile valley allowed Egyptian civilization to avoid the constant incursions that destroyed so many Mesopotamian cultures.
 - The Nile is also very different from the Tigris and Euphrates that fed Mesopotamian civilization. Where the Tigris and Euphrates flood chaotically, the Nile floods in a regular, predictable fashion. This predictability had two main results. First, it makes it much easier to plant and harvest according to a regular time table, allowing for reliable and bountiful harvests. Second, the predictability of the Nile allowed for central planning of agriculture to be very successful. This bolstered the credibility and power of centralized authority.
 - Along the Nile, there grows a plant that grows nowhere else in the world, papyrus. As early as 3000 BCE, the Egyptians had discovered that the pith of this thin, reedy plant could be spread, flattened and dried to make a rudimentary sort of paper. While the Sumerians were busy poking sticks in clay tablets for millennia, the Egyptians were already using scrolls of papyrus to write. Records on Papyrus were lighter, easier to store and easier to make than clay tablets. This superior writing surface also allowed the Egyptians to retain their pictographic hieroglyphics long after the Sumerians had reduced their pictographs to the more abstract and standardized cuneiform. The superiority of papyrus was eventually recognized by the ancient world, and Egypt grew rich indeed on the export of paper.
 - In the Archaic Period, the First and Second Dynasties unified the Nile Valley to build the first Egyptian tate. They also centralized Egyptian religion through syncretism, as it allowed them to unify the various local gods into a single pantheon.
 - In the Old Kingdom, the Pharaohs of the Third through Sixth Dynasty reached the peak of their power and influence. The Pharaohs were worshipped as gods, and as such, built the pyramids as tombs to themselves.
 - In the First Intermediate Period, the Pharaohs decline dramatically in power and were engaged in a century and a half of civil war.
 - During the Middle Kingdom, the two regional dynasties struggled to reunify Egypt.
 - The Second Intermediate Period was a time of foreign rule, after the Hyskos conquered Northern Egypt and it took five dynasties to drive them out.
 - The New Kingdom was the second, and probably greater, peak of Egyptian power. They conquered along the Eastern Mediteranean coast, and even conquered mcuh of the Levant. However, they were stopped by the Hittites. Eventually Egypt would also fall to the Bronze age collapse, surviving as a husk only until Alexander The Great conquered it, and the Ptolemaic dynasty was established, which would last until the Roman conquest of Egypt.

#### 3.13. Ancient Egyptian Art:
 - Paintings were created to decorate tombs with the intent of assisting the deceased in sustaining their lives in the afterlife. Images often depicted the deceased completing daily tasks. The Egyptians believed they would continue many of these activities in the afterlife. Most of them were done in side profile, which is a characteristic of Egyptian art.
 - Although the most well known sculptures from Egypt are the monumental sculptures, small sculptures and reliefs have also been found. Sculptures were made of stone, wood and bronze. Statues of gods were often a mixture of a human body with the head of an animal. 
 - Egyptians also created pottery out of clay. Pottery held images of gods, animals and people. Subjects were depicted in the same manner as people in paintings, with a profile of the head and a frontal view of the body. Some pottery included hieroglyphics to tell a story.

#### 3.14. Egyptian Architecture
 - Structures called mastabas were built above underground burial tombs. These structures were a single story with a flat top. Mastabas also contained a chapel and a statue of the dead it housed. These buildings would eventually be replaced by intricate pyramids to house the remains of the dead.
 - An architect named Imhotep created the first version of a pyramid. This pyramid is known as a step pyramid. It was designed as several mastabas stacked on top of each other. Step pyramids eventually developed into geometric pyramids.
 - Giza held three pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The Great Pyramid was the largest of the three. The Sphinx is situated on the east side of the complex.
 - The Middle Kingdom refers to the years around 2030 BCE to 1640 BCE. During this time, pyramid-building remained popular. Pharaohs, the ruling kings over Egypt, built pyramids to hold their elaborate tombs. Like all Egyptians, pharaohs wanted to ensure they would be able to sustain their life in the afterlife.
 - The New Kingdom time period spanned from about 1550 BCE to 1070 BCE. As Egypt gained more control over its landholdings, prosperity inspired the construction of monuments. Much of this construction occurred in the current capital city of Thebes. The most popular structure was the temple, as it represented the power of the priest class.
 - Two of the most famous temple complexes (temple areas that contain more than one temple structure) are located in the area once known as Thebes. The complex at Karnak is made up of four parts, named the Precinct of Montu, the Precinct of Mut, the Temple of Amenhotep IV and the Precinct of Amon-Re. There are also several smaller temples located outside of the walls of the complex. This is one of the largest known complexes covering over one and a half square miles.

#### 2.15. Iron vs Bronze
 - With the collapse of the Bronze Age around 1200 B.C.E., trade networks fell apart. This had many consequences for Bronze Age civilizations. One of the most catastrophic was that they could no longer acquire the tin they needed to make bronze.
 - Deprived of their choice metal, ancient metallurgists cast about to find a new material to work with. What they came up with was iron.
 - Iron was hardly a new discovery. It is the most common element on Earth. The Hittites had been smelting iron since at least 2000 B.C.E. Yet for 800 years, ancient metallurgists preferred to work with bronze.
 - Why, knowing today as we do that iron is far superior? The answer is much harder to work, while the finished product is not much harder. More than that, copper and tin ores are easier to extract - even with their geographical distance from each other - compared to iron ores. Also, Iron requires much more heat to work than iron. Thus, until the collapse of the Bronze Age, iron was not a viable alternative.
 - While wrought iron was not much stronger than bronze, a small addition of carbon (about 2%) could turn iron into steel. This discovery was probably accidental. Fires generate a great deal of carbon. Each time they put the iron back into the fire to work, they added a bit more carbon to the metal.
 - Steel is one of the hardest substances on the planet. It is certainly much stronger than bronze. This added strength meant that less steel had to be used to make effective tools, weapons or armor, making steel a lighter alternative. This strength also allows steel to hold an edge better than bronze.
 - By 1100 B.C.E., iron had replaced bronze as the metal of choice in the Near East. Another three centuries would see it spread across Europe.


#### 2.16. Iron Age Empires
 - Following the Bronze Age collapse, the ancient world was in constant turmoil for nearly four centuries. Amid this chaos, kingdoms quickly rose and fell.
 - Perhaps the most famous of these short-lived kingdoms was the Kingdom of Israel. United under a single monarch, King Saul, the Israelites slowly conquered their neighboring Canaanites, Hittites and Philistines. By 1004 BCE, Saul's successor, King David, had carved out the borders of the kingdom of Israel and established Jerusalem as its capital. David's son, King Solomon the Wise, built an amazing temple to hold the Ark of the Covenant. After centuries of wandering, the Ark finally had a home.
 - Yet stability would prove short-lived. Around 950 BCE, ten of the twelve tribes of Israel rebelled against their extravagant kings, breaking the kingdom in two. To the north, the ten tribes formed the Kingdom of Israel, while to the south, Solomon's dynasty continued to rule the Kingdom of Judah. This division could not have come at a worse time, for it left the Israelites vulnerable to the new empires emerging to the east.
 - Around 935 BCE, the ancient civilization of Assyria had begun to stir once more. Due to its distance from the main centers of invasion and its own military might, Assyria had weathered the Bronze Age collapse better than most. In the interim, they had mastered the art of iron working.
 - Their mastery of iron made Assyrian soldiers some of the most dangerous in the world. They had also begun the full-scale construction of siege equipment, which allowed their tide of conquest to flow quickly, without getting held up at fortified cities. Perhaps the most ruthless aspect of Assyrian conquest was their system of deportation. Under Assyrian rule, conquered peoples were forcibly relocated from their lands to other parts of the empire, while Assyrian colonists settled the newly conquered territory. By breaking people from their lands, the Assyrians smashed resistance before it could start and sought to assimilate the new peoples into their empires(this was an easy way to gain a lot of skilled population.)
 - Within a century, the Assyrians had conquered most of the Fertile Crescent, and had begun to push against the Levant. Through alliance with their neighbors, the Israelites fought off the invading Assyrians for a while, but the closest they ever came to victory was a stalemate at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BCE.
 - Emboldened by instability in the Assyrian homeland, the Israelites spent the next century trying to throw off their Assyrian overlords, until 744 BCE, when Assyria finally found a leader to match their imperial ambitions. His name was Tiglath-Pileser III. Tiglath staged a military coup, reunited the Assyrian empire and recovered the lost territories. He reorganized these territories into imperial provinces which paid a set tribute and provided soldiers in war time. Well-organized and rich with tribute, Tiglath organized his soldiers into the world's first proper standing army and began a war of expansion.
 - The kingdom of Israel managed to hold off the Assyrian expansion until in 738 BCE, the King of Judah betrayed the Kingdom of Israel, allying his kingdom with the conquerors. With Judah's help, Tiglath wiped the Kingdom of Israel off the map, expelling its inhabitants from the land and spreading them within the empire. However, with the aid of allies as far flung as Egypt, the Israelites continued to resist Assyrian rule and refused to pay tribute. Infuriated by this perpetual insurrection, Tiglath's successors would continue the practice of displacing the rebellious Israelites. His son Shalmanaser seems to have done little else in his three-year reign. He died besieging the Israelite capital of Samaria. His top general Sargon seized power and established himself by completely destroying Israel. Within 20 years, ten tribes of Israel were lost forever. Only the two tribes of the Kingdom of Judah remained. We call this mass displacement the First Israelite Diaspora and the ten tribes the Lost Tribes of Israel.
 - One thousand years after Hammurabi built the first Babylonian empire, Babylon had not forgotten its former primacy in all that time. Throughout Assyrian reign, Babylon was always the first to rebel - the first to take advantage of every weakness. Now, with the Assyrians out of the picture, Babylon attempted to reclaim its former glory. At the head of this expansion was the ambitious king Nebuchadnezzar II. Nebuchadnezzar conquered much of the previous Assyrian Empire, though he didn't make it all the way to Egypt.
 - In his conquest he made use of the same imperial bureaucracy, road system, and military tactics that had made the Assyrians so successful. Like the Assyrians, he struggled with the descendants of Abraham. To bring them to heel, he did to Judea what the Assyrians had done to Israel. He drove out their inhabitants and began what his victims called the Babylonian Captivity.
 - Babylon's time in the sun would be short lived, however. To the east, their old allies, the Medes, were having trouble with a group of invaders from the Bronze Age collapse, the Persians. The Persians had been vassals - first of the Assyrians, then of the Medes. In 549 BCE, the Persian king, Cyrus, rebelled against Median control. By 539 BCE, he had conquered the Medes and moved on to invade the Babylonian Empire. His conquest is remarkable for its speed and its genius. Confronted by the walled city of Babylon, Cyrus diverted the Euphrates River, which fed the city its water. Dying of thirst, Babylon capitulated without a fight.
 - Yet Cyrus did not build his empire on pure military might. Like Assyria, Babylon had not been friendly to its provinces. Cyrus exploited the discontent of Babylon's vassals. Assyria was the first to switch to the Persian side at the promise of semi-autonomy. Yet Cyrus was just as kind to the little guys as the big players. He allowed all the peoples displaced by the Babylonians to return to their homes with their gods. Under Cyrus, the Babylonian Captivity ended, and Israel was re-established as a kingdom.
 - Soon the Persians became known as liberators, and province after province welcomed them with open arms. Cyrus enacted laws of religious tolerance, rebuilt temples, and founded new cities, eventually earning the respect even of the Babylonians he had conquered. With this combination of military might and deft diplomacy, Cyrus built the largest empire ever known to man.
 - Upon the death of Cyrus, his son Cambyses would take Egypt by force and add it to the empire. While he was away campaigning though, a group of Zoroastrian priests installed a puppet king, who would be deposed by Cambyses' cousin Darius. 
 - Like Cyrus, Darius showed amazing foresight. He rebuilt and reconnected the chaotic system of roads left by previous empires. He encouraged religious freedom, while incorporating himself into the religions of his subjects. He gave the kingdoms of the empire a certain degree of autonomy, and he came up with a fair system of imperial taxation. His new capital at Persepolis was one of the most magnificent cities ever built, full of beautiful palaces, glorious temples and beautiful artwork. Persepolis' position as the seat of a powerful empire can best be seen in the Gates of All Nations.
 - Even more remarkable than his work at home was Darius' expansion abroad. Darius expanded the empire in all directions. To the east he pressed into India. To the south, he extended Persian power from Egypt into Libya. To the north, he crossed the Dardanelles and began an invasion of Europe. In the course of 30 years, the Persians had gone from an obscure tribe of nomadic pastoralists to the leaders of the most powerful empire in history.
 - At its peak, it controlled all the way from what is now the Western Border of Pakistan to touch Greece.

#### 2.17. Persian Art
 - Sculptures were generally found only in the palaces, but they could also be found among the routes within the empire. Bas-reliefs, carvings in which the figures are barely more prominent than their background, have been found along roads to glorify their king. Persians were inspired by Greek columns. The column became a very popular structure in Persian architecture. The number of columns included was generally a multiple of four. Cyrus' palace at Pasargadae held columns that were surmounted by bulls' heads.
 - The ancient city of Persepolis was built to contain numerous palaces. Many buildings have been uncovered, though their specific purposes are not clear. Structures also included a grand staircase with double ramps, cut rock for terrace gardens, barracks and a fortress. Xerxes built a palace in the area of modern-day Shiraz. This palace was known as The Gate of All Nations. It consisted of a grand hall with four columns, an entrance and two other doors opening in different directions.
 - Bronze was a popular choice for many parts of buildings, such as doorways. Gold and silver were also used to create elaborate ornaments like rhytons (a horn-shaped vessel used for drinking) and other dishes. They were also used to make handles of vases. The handles would be shaped to represent the head of an animal or its body. Persia was also the home of exquisite pieces of jewelry. Bracelets, rings and earrings made of gold held colored stones. Some jewelry and miniature amulets were also made of other materials like turquoise and a vibrant blue stone called lapis lazuli.

#### 2.18. Zoroastrianism
 - Zoroastrianism is one of the oldest religions still active today, so who was Zoroaster? Zarathustra, better known as Zoroaster (the Greek version of his name), was a prophet from Persia. He believed that he had visions of a god whom he called Ahura Mazda.
 - Ahura Mazda, according to the prophet, was the creator of all things good. He was the true god who should be worshiped. The worship of one god is called monotheism. Zoroaster's monotheistic tendencies were a new movement from the polytheistic religion previously known in Persia. Zoroastrianism is also dualistic, meaning it focuses on a twofold nature of the world (good and evil or heaven and hell, for example). Zoroaster believed that the universe was constantly under the conflict between good and evil.
 - In Zoroaster's vision, he went to heaven and spoke to Ahura Mazda. Ahura Mazda explained that he had a rival named Angra Mainyu, who was an evil being.
 - This is a good example of the religion's dualistic belief pattern. Zoroaster was told to encourage humanity to choose between good and evil, between Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu. Although Zoroastrianism isn't completely monotheistic because it recognizes more than one god, it does attempt to consolidate the worship of people under one most powerful god.
 - Zoroaster taught that each person had the freedom to choose good or evil in the choices he or she makes. For example, choosing to tell the truth rather than to tell a lie indicates a person has chosen good over evil. The prophet also taught that there was an eternal afterlife, and the choices made by each person determined his or her destiny in this afterlife. If a person's good choices and deeds outweighed the bad, he or she would go to heaven. If a person made more bad decisions or did evil deeds, that person would go to one of the several levels of hell, depending on his or her degree of evilness.
 - Also within his religion, Zoroaster taught the existence of angels, demons and saviors, ideas that can also be found in Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Zoroastrians use the Avesta as their sacred text. The Avesta contains hymns, rituals and spells against demons. Several times the Avesta was destroyed, but it was rewritten from memory/tradition(this was something that Khosrau Anushirawan would do during his reign, and something that helped to establish his credentials as the greatest Sassanid king(besides for domianting Justinian on a number of occasions, though Belisarius did win a major victory at Dara))
 - Zoroastrianism was so popular it influenced a lot of other religions. In the second and third centuries CE, the cult of Mithras became a popular religion among Romans, especially Roman soldiers.
 - The cult was a secretive, ritualistic religion in which little record is known. Initiates were not allowed to record information regarding its beliefs, so documentation comes from outside sources. Mithras was a god known in the polytheistic religion that existed in Persia before the spread of Zoroastrianism. Zoroaster, however, incorporated Mithras as a lesser god or possibly an angel figure under Ahura Mazda. Mithras may have ruled over the Earth, while Ahura Mazda ruled over all creation.

#### 2.19. Cult of Mithras
 - Mithras was the name of an ancient Persian god who was adopted into Roman beliefs. Mithraism was a secretive cult religion. Beliefs were known only to its initiates, who were not allowed to record their knowledge. This secretive nature is what designates Mithraism as a mystery religion.
 - Because of its secretive nature, we don't know much about the cult until it came to Rome. Mithraism was most popular in Rome between the second and fourth centuries CE. The spread of Mithraism into Rome is mostly undocumented. However, we do have some sources from outside the cult, including those from ancient texts of writers like Plutarch, Porphyry, Tertullian, and Origen. The cult, which was only open to men, became especially popular within the Roman military. Archeologists have found that it was most popular in the second century CE, dying out during the reign of the Roman Emperor Constantine(due to his enforcement of Christianity as the state religion of the Empire).
 - In Rome, Mithras was considered a sun god but also a bull-slayer, a cattle-thief, and a 'savior' to his initiates. Members of the cult believed it was important to be loyal and were expected to build friendships with other members. Although Zoroastrians believed they should spread their knowledge, helping Mithraism spread, cult members in Rome believed very strongly that their beliefs and rituals should not be shared. There is no known first-hand account from an initiate to help us understand their belief system.
