#### 2.1. The Invention of Writing
 - Writing was invented somewhere between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia. They were written into soft clay, which was then baked in the sun. Small symbols, called Cuneiform, were used to represent words, syllables, or objects.
 - The greatest benefit was the ability for societies to keep records. This allowed for a bureaucracy to form, and for the first time, a government could keep track of its citizens. While some today might see this as a negative, it was a huge step forward for civilization. It allowed for the creation of laws, and the ability to enforce them. More than that, it allowed for efficiencies to compound, further increasing the surplus of food and goods.


#### 2.2. The Invention of Money
 - This is an extremely simplified version of an extremely complex topic.
 - In the era before money, barter was the only means of exchange. This was extremely inefficient, as it required a double coincide of wants. In non-economics-nerd speak, it means that if I have fish and want clothes, and you have clothes but don't want fish, we can't trade. However, with the use of a universal medium of exchange, we can trade. This is the purpose of money.
 - For a long time, the medium of exchange was gold, silver or other precious metals. However on the Island of Yap, they used large stones as money. The stones were so large that they were immobile, and so they were never moved. Instead, the ownership of the stone was transferred. This is a great example of how money is a social construct. It is only valuable because we all agree that it is valuable. 
 - Until recently though, the size of an economy was limited by the amount of gold in the world. This is because the amount of money in an economy was limited by the amount of gold. However, with the invention of paper money, this is no longer the case. Now, the amount of money in an economy is limited by the amount of paper money in the economy. This is why inflation is a thing. The more money there is, the less valuable it is. This is why the US dollar is worth less than it was 100 years ago. However, the benefits of having a non-fixed money supply are huge. It allows for the economy to grow much faster than it would otherwise.

#### 2.3. Development of Religion
 - Mother Goddesses were the first deities. They were associated with fertility, and were worshiped by the first civilizations. This has led to speculation that the first civilizations were matriarchal, but there is limited evidence to support any theory.
 - The first male gods were associated with 'destructive' things - volcanoes, the sea, etc. Men were associated with violence, and thus the gods associated with violent things were seen as being inherently male.

#### 2.4. The Fertile Crescent
 - The Fertile Crescent is roughly an area from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. It is the area where the first civilizations developed. 
 - The two main rivers in the Fertile Crescent are the Tigris and Euphrates, and together they form an area called Mesopotamia. 
 - The Mesopotamian civilizations were the first(or first we know of) to develop a system of totally sedentary agriculture. They built complex(for the time) irrigation systems, and were able to produce a reliable surplus of food.
 - As previously discussed, this allowed for the development of a bureaucracy to manage the surplus, and the development of a government to enforce the laws.

#### 2.5. Sumerian Art and Architecture
 - We get some of the first non-cuneiform art from Ur. The city may have been founded by the Ubaids, who preceded the Sumerians in inhabiting the area. Ur became so powerful that it held control over all of Sumer at varying times. The Standard of Ur is an artifact that was found in an excavation at Ur. It consists of a number of wooden fragments containing vivid mosaics. 
 - Another artifact from Ur is a ziggurat, a kind of stepped-pyramid. It was a temple to the moon god Nanna.

#### 2.7. Heirs of the Sumerians
 - The growth of Babylon as the successor to Ur was due to Hammurabi, the first to unite all of Mesopotamia under one ruler since Ur. Hammurabi inherited a central, but rather unimportant kingdom of Mesopotamia. He led a well-disciplined fighting force to the conquest of his Amorite rivals, Isin and Larsa, as well as the already ancient cities of Ur and Uruk. By the time he was done, Babylon would be the seat of an empire stretching for thousands of miles. But Hammurabi was not sated with mere conquest.
 - However, he didn't want an empire held together by continual force, so he created a code of laws. The code was based on the principle of lex talionis, or "an eye for an eye". The code was written on a stone pillar, and placed in the center of Babylon. It was written in cuneiform, and was the first time that a law code had been written down. It was also the first time that a law code had been made public.
 - The Babylonians would continue to be the major power in the region until around 1600 BCE, when the Hittiies would sack the city - they were experts in the use of chariots and cavalry warfare generally, and had superior metalworking to aid their weaponry. However they had no interest in genuine conquest, and so they left Babylon to its own devices with their plunder.
 - The Hurrians filled this power vacuum in part of Mesopotamia, but the Assyrians would be the first to fully reclaim the mantle of the true rulers of the region. Where the Babylonians had been farmers and merchants ruled by priests, the Assyrians were first and foremost warriors. While their kings might have traced their descent from the city's patron deity, Ashur, it was in essence a military aristocracy.
 - The Kassite Babylonians tried to reclaim the full glory of the Babylonian empire, but they were never able to fully do so. Thus, a tri-party power struggle between the Kassite Babylonians, the Assyrians, and the Hittites would continue for centuries. 
 - This power struggle ended with the [Bronze Age Collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMP328eU5Q). The "Sea People" were a group of raiders, unknown to us today, who raided up and down the Mediterranean coast. This kicked off a wave of destabilization which would lead to the total collapse of the Hittites, and the total severing of trade routes.
