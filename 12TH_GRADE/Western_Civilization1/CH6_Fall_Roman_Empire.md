### The Fall of the Roman Empire

#### 6.1. The Early Empire
 - The Emperor Augustus, who found Rome a city of bricks and left it a marble, was not actually named Augustus. His name was Gaius Octavius, and his grand-uncle was Julius Caesar. When Caesar was assassinated, Octavius was named in his will as his heir. 
 - Octavian was not the only fellow hoping to succeed Caesar. When Octavian arrived in Rome after his uncle's assassination, he found Caesar's right hand man, Mark Antony, making his own bid for power.
 - The Senate used Octavian to get rid of Antony, yet the Senate had gotten more than they had bargained for in Octavian. Using the menace of Mark Antony as a goad, Octavian bullied the frightened Senate into granting him extraordinary powers for a man of his age. He was made a senator and granted the same powers as the consuls. More importantly, he was given legal control over the armies of Rome.
 - With his right hand man Agrippa(who deserves SO much more credit than he gets), Octavian defeated them in Gaul.
 - If Octavian had hoped for a hero's welcome upon returning to Rome, he was sorely disappointed. The Senate had grown wary of the young Octavian and were reluctant to grant him any more glory or power than they could avoid.
 - Realizing the situation, Octavian allied himself with Antony and another of Caesar's supporters named Lepidus. The three formed the Second Triumvirate, an alliance between Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus. Working together, these three men killed off their political rivals and seized their property in a series of political murders, known as proscriptions. This removed the last obstacles to absolute power and made the three very wealthy.
 - While Octavian and Antony had been fighting among themselves in the West, Caesar's assassins had been amassing power in the East. A conflict was inevitable, and in 42 BCE, the two sides clashed at the Battle of Phillipi. Caesar's assassins, the last champions of the Republic, were completely defeated, and Brutus, who had betrayed Caesar, took his own life.
 - A few years later in 36 BCE, the Triumvirate destroyed the fleet of Pompey Magnus's son, Sextus Pompeius, wiping out the last of those who had opposed Caesar.
 - With their common enemy destroyed, the members of the Triumvirate turned against one another. Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily, but his troops abandoned him, and he was exiled. But the biggest rivals in this conflict were Octavian and Antony, who soon turned against one another.
 - Antony was far more ambitious than Lepidus; he wanted the entire eastern Empire. He was setting himself up as an eastern despot and sought to rule all of the Empire from Egypt, with his queen Cleopatra, or at least that's what Octavian tried to convince the Romans. It might have even been true. Eventually this conflict came to a head, and in 31 BCE, the two sides met in a naval battle at Actium, in which Antony and Cleopatra's fleet was utterly destroyed.
 - After suffering another defeat the next year at Alexandria, the two committed suicide together, inspiring poets and playwrights through the ages.
 - After that many victories(shoutout Agrippa!), Augustus was bestowed the title "Imperator", of which we get the title "Emperor".
 - Augstus/Octavian was a crafty guy though, and rather than seizing authority and becoming a dictator, he allowed many of the offices of the Republic to remain. Octavian refused to be named dictator or even consul for life. Instead, he just made sure he held enough important positions to get him what he wanted. By maintaining the illusion of the Republic, Octavian gave his reign legitimacy.
 - That being said, the Senate still laid on the titles. They named Octavian proconsul: the governor of a province; they called him tribune: by which they meant he was a defender of the people; they hailed him as princeps: the first among equals; and finally, they gave him title by which we know him today, Augustus: which, in Latin, means dignified, majestic, sacred, venerable, and worthy of honor. We get the word "august" from this title.
 - By the time of his death, Augustus Caesar had transformed Rome from a city of bricks into a city of marble - and more than that, the Roman Republic was for all intents and purposes, dead, and the Roman Empire had been born.

#### 6.2. Augustus' Propagandists
 - Augustus' friend and advisor, Gaius Maecenas, was a great patron of the arts. He had collected a fine selection of poets, all eager for imperial sponsorship. Among his top talent were the poets Horace and Virgil. Though they probably did not know it, these poets would usher in a whole new age. Through their work, they would proclaim the glory of the Empire through the ages and establish their patron, Augustus, as the father of a new era, an Augustan era of peace and prosperity.
 - Virgil was a fanatical believer in Augustus, and he wrote a poem called the Aeneid, which was a rewriting of Roman history, putting Augustus center stage in the mythology of Greece & Rome. Throughout the Aeneid, Virgil suggests that the entirety of Roman history, from Aeneas' flight from Troy through Romulus' founding of Rome, was all leading up to Augustus. 
 - Quintus Horatius Flaccus, or as we known him, Horace, was a long time opponent, but in converting Horace, Augustus won great legitimacy. He wrote a series of poems proclaiming the great moral, military, and political victories of Augustus.
 - Finally, there was Ovid. By the time Ovid showed up, Augustus' propaganda project had long since completed its aim. Augustus' authority was unquestioned, and Augustus himself was revered in a way normally reserved for gods.
 - Yet, Ovid also seems to have had a rebellious streak. While Augustus was busy trying to reassert the sanctity of marriage and family values, Ovid wrote a set of naughty poems called the Ars Amatoria, or the Art of Love, which showed little regard for Augustus' strict moral code.
 - He also wrote his masterpiece, the Metamorphoses, in such a way that was seen as a backhand slight at the changes Augustus had implemented. Whether Ovid was trying to be subversive or not, Augustus clearly thought Ovid was dangerous, or at least annoying, for in 8 CE he exiled the poet to Tomis, a flyspeck of a town on the banks of the Black Sea. This was essentially banishment to the end of the Earth. Poor Ovid would spend the remainder of his life pining away for the city and culture he loved.
