#### 11.1: Graphing Probability Distributions for Random Variables
 - A random variable is a quantity that designates the possible outcomes of a random process. It's used to map the potential outcomes of a random process to numeric values. Random variables can be associated with both discrete and continuous processes. 
 - Processes that can be described by a discrete random variable include flipping a coin, picking a number at random, and rolling a die.
 - Conversely, examples of events associated with a continuous random variable include the height and weight distribution of people within a population. A good way to determine if the random variable is discrete or continuous is as follows: if there is a countable number of values that the random variable can take on, then it is discrete; otherwise, it is continuous.
 - The probability distribution function is a function that describes the likelihood of all the possible values that the random variable can take on.
 - Simply put, if the random variable is discrete, then the probability distribution function is going to be random, and if the random variable is continuous, then the probability distribution function is going to be continuous. Simple enough.
 - To graph a discrete probability distribution, a bar graph is a great way to display it. In mathematic terms, the function of rolling a die can be express as

 - For two dice, the probability distribution function is:

 - Now, a continuous probability distribution function can be graphed in a similar manner to a discrete one. The x-axis denotes the possible values that the random variable can have, while the y-axis denotes the corresponding probability for each value. The only big difference is that the graph would appear as a continuous curve.
