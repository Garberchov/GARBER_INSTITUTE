#### 2.3. How to calculate percent increase with relative and cumulative frequency tables
 - In mathematical terms, frequency is how often a particular value occurs in a data set. 
 - Cumulative frequency is the total number of times a specific value occurs in a data set.
 - Relative frequency is the number of times a specific value occurs divided by the total number of values.
 - Percent Increase = [(Frequency 2 - Frequency 1) / Frequency 1] âˆ— 100.
 - For example: ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/percent_increase_ex1.png)
 - for the increase in robbery, it would be ((37-33)/33)*100 = 12% increase
 - for the increase in murder, it would be ((8-2)/2)*100 = 300%
 - for the increase in assault, it would be ((16-15)/15)*100 = 7%

#### 2.4. Stem and Leaf Displays
 - A stem-and-leaf display is a visual representation of data where the stem, the data on the left side of the chart, shows one part of the value while the leaves, the data on the right side of the chart, show the other.
 - These help to explain the frequency of data in a highly visual way.

#### 2.5. Histograms
 - A histogram is another graphical representation of the frequency and distribution of data in question.
 - The x axis in a histogram is the values in the data set, and the y axis is the number of times that it appears in the data set.
 - A skewed data set is when the shape of a graph peaks away from center. For analysis of many things, it is helpful to "normalize" a data set towards the center.

#### 2.6. Frequency Polygons
 - A frequency polygon is a line graph created by joining all of the top points of a histogram. They are called polygons because the line the graph creates resembles half of a polygon.
 - They are useful because they can be used to compare two data sets on the same graph.
 - In addition they can:
    - Show the shape of the distribution of data.
    - Can be seen without histogram axes.
    - Have end points that can be extended to make axis lines.
    - Can be used for area comparisons.
