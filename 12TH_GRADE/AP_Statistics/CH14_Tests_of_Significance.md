#### 14.1 Hypothesis Testing: The Basics
 - We define hypothesis test as the formal procedures that statisticians use to test whether a hypothesis can be accepted or not. A hypothesis is an assumption about something. For example, a hypothesis about family pets could be something like the average number of dogs per American household is less than two. It isn't something you KNOW, but if you can test it and find whether it is acceptable or not.
 - There is a proper four-step method in performing a proper hypothesis test: Write the hypothesis, Create an analysis plan, Analyze the data, Interpret the results.
 - The first step is that of writing the hypothesis. You actually have two hypotheses to write. One is called the null hypothesis. This is the hypothesis based on chance. Think of this as the hypothesis that states how you would expect things to work without any external factors to change it. The other hypothesis is called the alternative hypothesis. This is the hypothesis that shows a change from the null hypothesis that is caused by something. The world isn't perfect, so having an alternative hypothesis "banked" is important. When writing them, you must do so that they are mutually exclusive. For example, the null hyptothesis could be that the average number of dogs per American household is less than two, and the alternative hypothesis could be that the average number of dogs per American household is greater than two two. These are mutually exclusive because they are opposites of each other. You can't have both be true at the same time.
 - The second step is to create an analysis plan. This involves deciding how to read your results to know whether your null hypothesis is true or your alternative hypothesis is true. Usually, this involves analyzing just one single test statistic.
 - There are two ways to read your results: P-value method and the region of acceptance method. The P-value is the probability of observing the desired statistic. If this P-value is less than the significance level, then the null hypothesis is not valid. The significance level is the probability of making the mistake of saying that the null hypothesis is not valid when it actually is true. The region of acceptance is a chosen range of values that results in the null hypothesis being stated as valid. For example, if the region of acceptance is 99% and there is >99% probabiltiy that the null hypothesis is true, then the null hypothesis is valid. If it is < 99%, then the null hypothesis is not valid and the alternative hypothesis is valid.
 - The third step is that of analyzing the data. It is the putting step two into action. It is in this step that the data is analyzed and either a P-value is found, or the data's region is found, > or < than the significance level desired.
 - The fourth step involves interpreting the results. It is in this step that the data is compared to the region of acceptance or the significance level. If the P-value is less than the significance level, then the null hypothesis is not valid. If the data is within the region of acceptance, then the null hypothesis is valid.

#### 14.2. Conducting Hypothesis Testing for a Mean
 - For doing an average hypothesis test, it is better to use the p-value method. When calculating the p-value, if it is very low, then the null hypothesis is very unlikely to be true. If it is high, then the null hypothesis is likely to be true.
 - First, the t-statistic must be found. This is done by using the formula: t = (xbar - mu)/(s/sqrt(n)). The xbar is the sample mean, the mu is the population mean, the s is the sample standard deviation, and the n is the sample size.
 - For example, if you were trying to calculate IQ average in a group, if the average was 110 that would be the xbar - if the population average was 100, that would be the mu - if the sample standard deviation was 10, that would be the s - and if the sample size was 30, that would be the n. So, the t-statistic would be (110 - 100)/(10/sqrt(30)) = 5.476. 
 - Next, the degrees of freedom must be found. This is done by using the formula: df = n - 1. The n is the sample size. So, if the sample size was 30, the degrees of freedom would be 29.
 - Next, the alpha value has to be found. This is something that you choose - generally it is 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10. For the purposes of this example, we will use 0.05.
 - Finally is the t-table - this is something that can be found online, and you cross-check the degrees of freedom with the alpha value to find the critical value. With 29 degrees of freedom and 0.05 alpha value, the critical value is 1.699. Since that t-critical is less than the t-statistic, the value is accepted.

#### 14.3. Effect Size
 - The formal procedure statisticians follow to determine whether a certain hypothesis is valid or not is referred to as hypothesis testing. By using hypothesis testing, statisticians can validate statements such as, 'This washer only needs one gallon of water to wash a large load of clothes.'
 - Hypothesis testing is a 4-step process: Step 1: Write the hypothesis, Step 2: Create an analysis plan, Step 3: Analyze the data,  Step 4: Interpret the results.
 - We define effect size as the objective and standardized measure of the size of a particular effect. We can think about our effect size as the importance of a certain effect. The larger the effect size, the more important the effect. The more important the effect, the more easily it can be seen by just looking.
 - For example, if our effect is the growing of beards by men, we can say that a large effect size will mean that there are more men who grow beards. A small effect size means there are few men who grow beards. If our effect size is 0, then there are no men who grow beards.
 - The effect size is important because it can help us to determine whether a certain effect is important or not. If we have a large effect size, then we can say that the effect is important. If we have a small effect size, then we are giving overvaluing it if we decide that it is important. If we have an effect size of 0, then we can say that the effect is not important.
 - Because the effect size is an objective and standardized way of measuring effect, we can use it compare different hypothesis tests to each other. We can compare the effect sizes of the different hypothesis tests to see which hypothesis test gives us the greatest effect size or the least effect size.


#### 14.4. Type I and Type II Errors
 - A Type I error is when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. This is also known as a false positive. For example, if you said(and "proved") that every American can dunk a basketball, that would be a Type I error. 
 - A Type II error is when the null hypothesis is accepted when it is actually false. This is also known as a false negative. For example, if you said(and "proved") that no American can dunk a basketball, that would be a Type II error.

#### 14.5. The Relationship between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests
 - if we wanted to find the average weight of a box of grapes ahead of time, we wouldn't want to harvest all of the grapes and then weight them. No we would take a small sample, <30, and then use that to find the average weight of the box.
 - If we took a sample of 12 boxes of grapes and found that the mean weight was 43.5, a standard deviation of 3.947, and the ideal was 41.5 is this close enough to the ideal? We can use a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis to find out. The null hypothesis could be that the average weight of a box of grapes is 41.5, and the alternative hypothesis could be that the average weight of a box of grapes is not 41.5. Then, we could choose a significance level, like 0.05, and then use the p-value method to find out if the null hypothesis is valid or not.  If the p-value is less than or equal to α we decide to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than α we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
 - Calculating it out, we find that the p-value is 0.1060, which is greater than 0.05. So, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
 - We can however, use this to find out the confidence interval. Using the previous values, we can find that the confidence interval is [41, 46]. This means that we can be 95% confident that the average weight of a box of grapes is between 41 and 46 pounds

#### 14.6. Hypothesis Testing Large Independent Samples
 - Let's say we are comparing the means µ1 and µ2 of two different populations and that we want to compare the difference of these two population means using something called the z-test, but to do that a few assumptions have to be true:
    1. The samples have to be independent
    2. The samples have to be normally distributed with known standard deviations; or the sample sizes have to be "large"(>30)
 - Standard deviation is the amount of variation in a set of data values. A large independent sample is a sample size that is greater than or equal to 30. In such a scenario, we hold the following to be true: the null hypothesis, H0, tells us that µ1 is equal to µ2. The alternative hypothesis, HA, tells us that µ1 is not equal to µ2.
 - Assuming both of our randomly selected samples have a size of at least 30 and that they are independent of one another, a z-test can be used to determine any difference between two population means. We don't need to know the actual population means, because we are testing the difference between the population means based on the means of the samples. The equation for the z-test is:
 - ![I would type it out in Latex, but I have no idea how to do that for this](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/hypothesis_1.png)
 - Where (x1 - x2) represents the observed difference in our respective sample means, where (µ1 - µ2) is the expected difference in populations means, which is 0, since H-naught tells us that µ1 is equal to µ2, which alternative means µ1 - µ2 = 0.
 - It also tells us where the denominator represents the standard error. In the denominator the symbol Sigma represents the standard deviation, and the letter n stands for each respective sample size. The standard deviation, in this case, represents the variability of individual observations around their mean, while the standard error, in simple terms, represents the variability of the sample mean across different samples.
 - An example of this would be if the average speeding ticket in Chicago was $85, in Seattle $80. Assume 60 is the sample size for each city. The standard deviation for Chicago is $5, and for Seattle is $4. The z-test would be  (85-80) = 5, (µ1 - µ2) = 0, and then $z = (5-0)/sqrt((5^2/60) + (4^2/60)) = 6.049, which is greater than 1.96, which means we reject the null hypothesis at significance level 0.05.


#### 14.7. Hypothesis Testing Matched Pairs
 - In statistics, paired or matched samples are synonymous terms for two dependent samples, those where each sample's data value is collected from the same source. Meaning, they depend on one another somehow. A good example would be testing the heart rate of 20 people before and after they run a mile.
 - To figure out if there is a significant difference between the matched pairs, we need to use the following equation:
 - ![I don't know the Latex for this](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/matchedpairs.png)
 - Our test statistic is t. d is the mean of the paired differences in our sample. mud is the mean of the paired differences for the entire population. sd is the standard deviation of the paired differences in the sample, and n refers to the total number of paired sample differences.
 - For example, if we had 6 employees doing sales and brought in an outside manager and we found out that the $d$ was -3.833, the $s_d$ was 8.886, and the $n$ was 6 with a significance level of 0.01, we could come to a conclusion. The null hypothesis could be that that the $mu_d$ is equal to 0, that there is no difference between the two. The alternative hypothesis could be that the $mu_d<0$, that the sales increase. We then plug in the numbers and find that $t=-1.057$. Given our degrees of freedom(5), we find that the critical value is -3.365. Since -1.057 is greater than -3.365, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

#### 14.8. Hypothesis Testing for Proportions
 - A proportion is a part of a whole. For example, if we were to say that 1/3 of the class is passing, that would be a proportion.
 - We can use hypothesis testing for a proportion to perform a statistical analysis to help us answer questions such as: Do more than a certain percentage of people in a population have a certain characteristic? Do more than 80% of married couples have children? Do more than 50% of men in New York City have a college degree? 
 - In all of those examples they are EXCLUSIVE, meaning that they are either true or false, but not both.
 - Let's use the chicken or fish preference as an example. The first thing we have to do is make sure the conditions are met to perform a hypothesis test for a proportion. Conditions are things that have to be true in order for the test to be valid or useful. There are four conditions:
   1. The sample has to be random, meaning the part of the population used has to be unbiased.
   2. They have to be mutually exclusive, meaning that they can't be both true at the same time.
   3. The sample size has to include at least 10 successes and 10 failures. This is to make sure that the sample is large enough to be representative of the population.
   4. The population size is at least 20 times the sample size. 
 - If all of these conditions are met, then you are ready to state both a null and alternative hypothesis. So in our chicken versus fish example, the null hypothesis would look like this: $H0: p >= 0.75$, and the alternative hypothesis would look like this: $Ha: p < 0.75$. The null hypothesis would be that we think that 75% or more of the population prefers chicken, and the alternative hypothesis would be that we think less than 75% of the population prefers chicken.
 - Our first step is to perform a z-test. In a random sample of 100 Americans, 60% preferred chicken to fish. We want to see if that statistic can be used to predict how many of the total population of Americans will prefer chicken to fish. The follow up to this would be to convert z-test to a p-value. Using the standard normal distribution chart, if z = -3.49, p=0.0002. That is way less than .75, so it is safe to say that less than 75% of the population prefers chicken to fish.
