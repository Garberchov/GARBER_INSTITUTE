#### 4.1. Measures of Center
 - The mean is the sum of the numbers in a data set divided by the total number of values in the data set. The mean is also commonly known as the average. 
 - The median is the midpoint value of a data set, where the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. The median can be used to get an idea of what values fall above the midpoint and what values fall below the midpoint. There is equal likelihood that the values in the data set will fall either above or below the median. Median is best used for a data set with numbers that have a few larger or smaller numbers and several numbers close together.

#### 4.2. Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency
 - Mean: defined as the data's average score of the sample
 - Median: defined as the middle score after the scores have been arranged in numerical order 
 - Mode: defined as the most often occurring value
