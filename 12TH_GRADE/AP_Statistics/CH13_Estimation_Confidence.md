### Chapter 13: Estimation and Confidence Intervals

#### 13.1 Point & Interval Estimates
 -  An estimation is the tool that is used in mathematics to make inferences about populations from data.
 - A point estimation is a type of estimation that uses a single value, a sample statistic, to infer information about the population. Point estimation can be a sample statistic. The sample mean of age for the sample, 32, can be used as a point estimation.
 - Point estimation is a single value that can be inferred as a popilation parameter. A parameter is the characteristics used to describe a population. 
 - Interval estimation is the range of numbers in which a population parameter lies considering margin of error. Because there is a certain level of uncertainty, an interval estimate gives a range, rather than a single value, of the population parameters.

#### 13.2 Calculating Confidence Intervals
 - When we use interval estimation, we don't assign just one value to the population mean. Instead, we form an interval around a point estimate. We follow this up with a statement that denotes that this interval, much broader in scope than just one point estimate, likely contains the population mean.
 - The confidence interval can be summed up as the point estimate +/- the margin of error. There are also associated terms, such as the confidence level, which is the probability that the interval estimate contains the population parameter. The confidence level is denoted by 1 - alpha, where alpha is the level of significance. The level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The level of significance is denoted by alpha.
 - There is also confidence coefficient, which is the probability that the interval estimate contains the population parameter. The confidence coefficient is denoted by 1 - alpha, where alpha is the level of significance. The level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The level of significance is denoted by alpha
