#### 7.1. Characteristics of a Well-Designed Survey
 - A survey is the study of a particular group of people of interested for the purpose of collecting data.
 - Yes or No questions are good when I just want to know if someone has a certain desired or undesired characteristic.
 - Open ended questions are good when you want the person to give you a detailed repsonse, but they are hard to analyze and generalize.
 - Rated questions are good when you want a scale of how much someone likes or dislikes something, but there is no way to know if one persons 5 is the same as another persons 5, or why they chose that number.
 - Types of survey are also important, and there are various cost-benefit tradeoffs for online, phone, and in-person surveys.
 - Last, but not least for your survey to be well-conducted, you'll need to choose an appropriate sample size for your market. Your sample size is a group of people that represents your target market. For example, instead of asking all girls if they like pink, maybe you'll ask 500 girls. You'll then use this information to generalize it to all girls. You need to select a number that is not too small, that is large enough for you to get a good idea of what you can expect others in the market to do.
