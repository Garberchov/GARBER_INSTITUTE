#### 10.1: Sets
 - A set is a collection of objects, and it doesn't need to be a number!
 - Philosphers have been using sets for categorizing things for a long time, but in math, we use them to categorize numbers.
 - For example, Z is a set of all integers, $ Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...} $
 - To collect sets together, we use the term union. We unite the sets into one.
 - To find elements in common with sets, we use the term intersection. Think of the sets as two roads that meet at an intersection. What do the two roads, or sets, have in common?
 - For example, $ A = {1, 2, 3} $ $B = {3, 4, 5} $ $A \cup B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} $ $A \cap B = {3} $

#### 10.2: Events as Subsets of a Sample Space:
 - When you conduct an experiment, you are observing certain outcomes. For example, you may be conducting an experiment on flipping a coin. The possible outcomes for flipping a coin are heads or tails. If you were rolling a six-sided die, then the possible outcomes would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. There are no other possible outcomes. We call these possible outcomes sample spaces. A sample space is a set (S) of a random experiment that includes all possible outcomes of the experiment.
 - An event is a possible outcome of an experiment. And a subset is an event of a sample space. 
 - Let's go back to our rolling the dice scenario. If you were to roll one die, your sample space would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. A subset of this sample space might be 1 because you can roll a die and get a 1. You cannot roll a die and get a 7. Therefore, 7 is not a subset of the sample space.
