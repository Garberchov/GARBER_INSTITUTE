### Chapter 10: Evaluating Probabilities

#### 10.1: Sets
 - A set is a collection of objects, and it doesn't need to be a number!
 - Philosphers have been using sets for categorizing things for a long time, but in math, we use them to categorize numbers.
 - For example, Z is a set of all integers, $ Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...} $
 - To collect sets together, we use the term union. We unite the sets into one.
 - To find elements in common with sets, we use the term intersection. Think of the sets as two roads that meet at an intersection. What do the two roads, or sets, have in common?
 - For example, $ A = {1, 2, 3} $ $B = {3, 4, 5} $ $A \cup B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} $ $A \cap B = {3} $

#### 10.2: Events as Subsets of a Sample Space:
 - When you conduct an experiment, you are observing certain outcomes. For example, you may be conducting an experiment on flipping a coin. The possible outcomes for flipping a coin are heads or tails. If you were rolling a six-sided die, then the possible outcomes would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. There are no other possible outcomes. We call these possible outcomes sample spaces. A sample space is a set (S) of a random experiment that includes all possible outcomes of the experiment.
 - An event is a possible outcome of an experiment. And a subset is an event of a sample space. 
 - Let's go back to our rolling the dice scenario. If you were to roll one die, your sample space would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. A subset of this sample space might be 1 because you can roll a die and get a 1. You cannot roll a die and get a 7. Therefore, 7 is not a subset of the sample space.

#### 10.3 Probability of Simple, Compound, Complementary Events
 - The probability of simple events is finding the probability of a single event occurring. When finding the probability of an event occurring, we will use the formula: number of favorable outcomes over the number of total outcomes. For example, if you were to roll a die, the probability of rolling a 1 would be 1/6(~16.666666). There is only one way to roll a 1, but there are six possible outcomes.
 - Compound events are a bit more complicated than that, it is the probability of more than one event happening together. To calculate the probability, we will use the formula: number of favorable outcomes over the number of total outcomes. Once we find the probability of each event occurring, we will multiply these probabilities together. For example, if you were to roll a die twice, the chance of getting a 1 both times would be 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36(~2.777777).
 - Complementary events are another type of event in which we can calculate the probability. Complementary events are events that add together to equal a whole or one. For example, if the probability of it raining today were 2/5, what would the probability be of it not raining? The probability of it not raining would be 3/5, because 2/5 + 3/5 would equal 5/5 or one whole. We know that there are only two choices: it will either rain or not rain.

#### 10.4. Probability of Independent and Dependent Events
 -  Independent events are events that do not affect the outcome of another event. For example, if you were to roll a die, what you get on the first roll will not affect what you get on the second roll. Therefore, the events are independent.
 - Dependent events are events that do affect the outcome of another event. For example, if you were to draw a card from a deck and not replace it, the probability of drawing a certain card would change. If you were to draw a card from a deck and replace it, the probability of drawing a certain card would not change. Therefore, the events are dependent if you do not replace the card and independent if you do replace the card.
 - For an independent event, the formula for finding the probability is: number of favorable outcomes over the number of total outcomes. For example, if you were to roll a die twice, the chance of getting a 1 both times would be 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36(~2.777777).
 - For a dependent event, the formula for finding the probability actually changes. For example, with the card pulling example, it would go from desired events / total number of outcomes, to desired events / total number of outcomes - number of cards pulled and not replaced.
