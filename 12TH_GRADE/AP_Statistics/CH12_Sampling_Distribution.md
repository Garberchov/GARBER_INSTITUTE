#### 12.1. Central Limit Theorem
 - On many graphs of normal distributions, you'll see that there's a line that runs right through the middle, at the highest point of the curve. This is aptly named the central line, and has a theorem named after it. The central limit theorem states that if you run a random experiment enough times the results will follow a normal distribution. In fact, the central limit theorem also states that the greater the opportunity for deviation amongst the variables, the greater that the final curve will resemble a normal distribution. Adding the results of two dice together will definitely look like a normal distribution, given enough rolls, while adding four or five dice together on each throw will look like a normal distribution much earlier.
 - This is obviously only true when it is ACTUALLY random, if you were looking for average heights and only measured the heights of basketball players, you would not get a normal distribution. This is because the sample is not random, and is skewed towards taller people.

#### 12.3. Finding Probabilities About Means Using the Central Limit Theorem
 - Why is the Central Limit Theorem important? It turns out that when the sample size is large enough, the following properties will hold:
 1. The mean of the population can be approximated by the mean of the sample means.
 2. The standard deviation of the population will be approximately equal to the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size.
 - These properties are very useful, because they allow us to use the normal distribution to find probabilities about the mean of a population, even when we don't know the standard deviation of the population when sampling it in the correct way.
