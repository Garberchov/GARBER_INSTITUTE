#### 6.1. Samples and Populations
 - When you are attempting to study a population, you have to collect information from everyone in that group. This makes it extremely difficult to study populations. For example, imagine if you are going to study a whole state's worth of people, that could be tens of millions.
 - Most social researchers realize that obtaining information from every person in a population is next to impossible. So instead of trying to collect everyone's information, they collect a sample of the population. A sample is a subset that is representative of the population as a whole. There are many sampling methods though, and some are better than others.
    - Random sample: each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
    - Stratified sample: a researcher divides the population into groups based on characteristics, and then the researcher randomly selects from each group based on its size.
    - Quota sample: a researcher deliberately sets a requirement to ensure a particular group is represented.
    - Purposive sample: a researcher purposefully focuses on a particular subset of a population.
    - Convenience sample: selection of the sample is based on ease of accessibility.
