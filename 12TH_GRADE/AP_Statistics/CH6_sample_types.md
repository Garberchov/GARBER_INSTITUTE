#### 6.1. Samples and Populations
 - When you are attempting to study a population, you have to collect information from everyone in that group. This makes it extremely difficult to study populations. For example, imagine if you are going to study a whole state's worth of people, that could be tens of millions.
 - Most social researchers realize that obtaining information from every person in a population is next to impossible. So instead of trying to collect everyone's information, they collect a sample of the population. A sample is a subset that is representative of the population as a whole. There are many sampling methods though, and some are better than others.
    - Random sample: each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
    - Stratified sample: a researcher divides the population into groups based on characteristics, and then the researcher randomly selects from each group based on its size.
    - Quota sample: a researcher deliberately sets a requirement to ensure a particular group is represented.
    - Purposive sample: a researcher purposefully focuses on a particular subset of a population.
    - Convenience sample: selection of the sample is based on ease of accessibility.

#### 6.2. Variance
 - Variance is the measure of how spread out a set of data is. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean.
 - The formula of population variance is sigma squared equals the sum of x minus the mean squared divided by n.

 - Or in text form, $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_(x - \mu)^2}{n}$$
 - The steps are actually quite simple:
      - Find the mean of the set of data.
      - Subtract each number from the mean.
      - Square the result.
      - Add the results together.
      - Divide by the number of items in the set.
 - The formula for sample variance looks like this:

 - step 5 for sample variance is slightly different. Divide the result by the total number of numbers in the data set minus one.
 - Remember that a sample is only part of the population and isn't actually the whole picture. Because of that, statisticians found a way to compensate, by subtracting one from the total number of numbers in the data set.


#### 6.3. Random Sampling
 - Random sampling is a method of selecting a sample from a population. It is a sequence of equally distributed random numbers. 
 - Some of the types of random sampling are:
     - Simple random samples
     - Stratified random samples
     - Cluster sampling
 - Random samples are best used to gather data about large populations.

#### 6.4. Simple Random Samples
 -  This takes us to simple random sampling or SRS, which is a type of random sampling where the variables have an equal and unsystematic chance of selection.
 - SRS would be like putting all of the names of the people in a population into a hat and then drawing out a certain number of names.

#### 6.5. Stratified Random Samples
 - Stratified random sampling is a random sampling method where you divide members of a population into 'strata,' or homogeneous subgroups.
 - There are two main rules, stratified random samples must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive(including all of the population).


#### 6.6. Cluster Sampling
 - Cluster sampling is the sampling method where different groups within a population are used as a sample. This is different from stratified sampling in that you will use the entire group, or cluster, as a sample rather than a randomly selected member of all groups.
 - There are two main rules, cluster sampling must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive(including all of the population).
 - You should use cluster sampling when:
     - The entire population is unclear or unknown
     - The sample clusters are geographically convenient
     - The clusters are 'natural' in a population
 - Sometimes you won't have an entire list of the members of a population or you won't have access to an entire population. In this case, you can use cluster sampling to collect information from the groups in the population.
 - If you wanted to get information about an entire state or county, but you don't have access to all the members all across the state, you can use the towns or counties that are geographically convenient to collect data. This is another example of cluster sampling; each town or county would be a naturally occurring cluster.
