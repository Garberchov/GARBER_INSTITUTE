#### 6.1. Samples and Populations
 - When you are attempting to study a population, you have to collect information from everyone in that group. This makes it extremely difficult to study populations. For example, imagine if you are going to study a whole state's worth of people, that could be tens of millions.
 - Most social researchers realize that obtaining information from every person in a population is next to impossible. So instead of trying to collect everyone's information, they collect a sample of the population. A sample is a subset that is representative of the population as a whole. There are many sampling methods though, and some are better than others.
    - Random sample: each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
    - Stratified sample: a researcher divides the population into groups based on characteristics, and then the researcher randomly selects from each group based on its size.
    - Quota sample: a researcher deliberately sets a requirement to ensure a particular group is represented.
    - Purposive sample: a researcher purposefully focuses on a particular subset of a population.
    - Convenience sample: selection of the sample is based on ease of accessibility.

#### 6.2. Variance
 - Variance is the measure of how spread out a set of data is. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean.
 - The formula of population variance is sigma squared equals the sum of x minus the mean squared divided by n.

 - Or in text form, $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_(x - \mu)^2}{n}$$
 - The steps are actually quite simple:
      - Find the mean of the set of data.
      - Subtract each number from the mean.
      - Square the result.
      - Add the results together.
      - Divide by the number of items in the set.
 - The formula for sample variance looks like this:

 - step 5 for sample variance is slightly different. Divide the result by the total number of numbers in the data set minus one.
 - Remember that a sample is only part of the population and isn't actually the whole picture. Because of that, statisticians found a way to compensate, by subtracting one from the total number of numbers in the data set.
