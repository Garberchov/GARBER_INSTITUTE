### Planning and Conducting Experiments

#### 8.1. True Experiments
 - A true experiment is a type of experimental design and is thought to be the most accurate type of experimental research. This is because a true experiment supports or refutes a hypothesis using statistical analysis. A true experiment is also thought to be the only experimental design that can establish cause and effect relationships. So, what makes a true experiment?
 - There are three criteria that must be met in a true experiment
    - Control group and experimental group
    - Researcher-manipulated variable
    - Random assignment 
 - True experiments must have a control group, which is a group of research participants that resemble the experimental group but do not receive the experimental treatment. The control group provides a reliable baseline data to which you can compare the experimental results.
 - In true experiments, the researcher has to change or manipulate the variable that is hypothesized to affect the outcome variable that is being studied. The variable that the researcher has control over is called the independent variable. The independent variable is also called the predictor variable because it is the presumed cause of the differences in the outcome variable.
 - Research participants have to be randomly assigned to the sample groups. In other words, each research participant must have an equal chance of being assigned to each sample group. Random assignment is useful in that it assures that the differences in the groups are due to chance. Research participants have to be randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group.

#### 8.2. Characteristics of a Well-Designed and Well-Conducted Experiment 
 - There are five main components that make an experiment well-designed, and well-conducted.
 - The first 3 components are the most important. Without these 3 components, nothing else you do for your experiment will matter. These 3 components are referred to as your control strategies that let you compare your results to a base neutral condition.
 - The first is a control group.
 - The second is a placebo.
 - This leads into the third component, blinding. Blinding means you don't tell your participants whether they are receiving a placebo or not. 
 - The fourth component involves randomly choosing who receives a placebo and who doesn't. This way, you eliminate variables that you may not consciously think of. For example, if you hand pick who gets a placebo and who doesn't, you might subconsciously pick those that you feel are most likely to respond for the real treatment and those you don't think will respond for the placebo.
 - Lastly, the fifth component involves your sample size, the number of participants or test subjects in your experiment. You need your sample size to be large enough so you can confidently say that the results apply to a much larger population.
