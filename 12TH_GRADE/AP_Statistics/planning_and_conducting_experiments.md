### Planning and Conducting Experiments

#### 8.1. True Experiments
 - A true experiment is a type of experimental design and is thought to be the most accurate type of experimental research. This is because a true experiment supports or refutes a hypothesis using statistical analysis. A true experiment is also thought to be the only experimental design that can establish cause and effect relationships. So, what makes a true experiment?
 - There are three criteria that must be met in a true experiment
    - Control group and experimental group
    - Researcher-manipulated variable
    - Random assignment 
 - True experiments must have a control group, which is a group of research participants that resemble the experimental group but do not receive the experimental treatment. The control group provides a reliable baseline data to which you can compare the experimental results.
 - In true experiments, the researcher has to change or manipulate the variable that is hypothesized to affect the outcome variable that is being studied. The variable that the researcher has control over is called the independent variable. The independent variable is also called the predictor variable because it is the presumed cause of the differences in the outcome variable.
 - Research participants have to be randomly assigned to the sample groups. In other words, each research participant must have an equal chance of being assigned to each sample group. Random assignment is useful in that it assures that the differences in the groups are due to chance. Research participants have to be randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group.

#### 8.2. Characteristics of a Well-Designed and Well-Conducted Experiment 
 - There are five main components that make an experiment well-designed, and well-conducted.
 - The first 3 components are the most important. Without these 3 components, nothing else you do for your experiment will matter. These 3 components are referred to as your control strategies that let you compare your results to a base neutral condition.
 - The first is a control group.
 - The second is a placebo.
 - This leads into the third component, blinding. Blinding means you don't tell your participants whether they are receiving a placebo or not. 
 - The fourth component involves randomly choosing who receives a placebo and who doesn't. This way, you eliminate variables that you may not consciously think of. For example, if you hand pick who gets a placebo and who doesn't, you might subconsciously pick those that you feel are most likely to respond for the real treatment and those you don't think will respond for the placebo.
 - Lastly, the fifth component involves your sample size, the number of participants or test subjects in your experiment. You need your sample size to be large enough so you can confidently say that the results apply to a much larger population. 

#### 8.3. What is a Control Group?
 - A control group is a group that is representative of the population you are studying, but does not receive the treatment you are investigating. The control group is used as a baseline to compare the results of the experimental group to(you can measure the effect of the treatment by comparing the results of the experimental group to the control group).

#### 8.5. Analyzing and Interpreting the Results of Randomized Experiments
 - First, you'll need to understand how to organize your data for analysis. You will need to ask yourself a few questions about your experiment first:
   - How is the independent variable being measured?
   - How is the dependent variable being measured?
   - What types of data are the independent and dependent variables?
 - Second, you'll need to critically analyze your own data. Be honest in your assessment of your experiment. Were there any mistakes that were made? Do you think there were any confounding variables or biases? What was your sample size? Consider the ethics in this particular research. Are you focused on confirming your hypothesis? Did this interfere with how you conducted the research? A level of detachment is necessary to ensure that your results are not biased.
 - You need to understand the limits of your experiment. This is important because in order to analyze and infer information about the experiment, you have to know exactly what the experiment can tell you and what it can't.
 - Most experiments will have what's called internal validity, which is when an experiment measures the variables that it was designed to measure. This is important because if an experiment has internal validity, you can be sure that there are generally consistent results across those you measured.
 - Outside of internal validity, there is also external validity, which is when the results of an experiment can be generalized to a larger population. This is important because if an experiment has external validity, you can be sure that the results of the experiment can be applied to a larger population.

#### 8.6. Confounding Variables
 - There are few ways that statistics can be incorrect as the result of an experiment, or an experiment can be incorrectly analyzed. This is called confounding, which in the context of statistics simply means something that interferes with or obscures your research. Three types of confounding we will discuss today are the placebo effect, confounding variables, and blinding.
 - The placebo effect is an effect that occurs from a fake treatment because the individual believes that the effect should occur.
 - Another way an experiment can be incorrectly analyzed is due to a confounding variable. Confounding variables are the other variables or factors that may cause research results. 
 - It is an outside factor that just isn't accounted for in the experiment. For example, if you are testing anxiety medication, and all of the people you study are also avid paintball players, you may find that the medication doesn't work as well as you thought. This is because the paintball players may have a higher level of adrenaline than the average person, and the medication may not be able to counteract that. (This isn't a real example, but it's a good way to think about it.)
 - Blinding refers to variables being tested on research groups when few individuals are aware of who's in the treatment and control groups. Blinding itself is not a bad thing - quite the opposite, in fact. It is the lack of blinding that causes confounding in statistical research. 

#### 8.7. Bias in Statistics
 - A bias is the intentional or unintentional favoring of one group or outcome over other potential groups or outcomes in the population.
 - These biases can come in the form of two main categories: selection bias and response bias.
 - Selection bias comes in several forms, non-representative samples, nonresponse bias, and voluntary response bias.
 - A non-representative sample refers to when the method with which a sample is selected specifically excludes certain groups from the research, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
 - A nonresponse bias describes the members of a sample that do not choose to respond or participate in the research and the characteristics of those members.
 - A voluntary bias describes the members of a sample that choose to respond or participate in the research, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
 - Response bias most commonly occur with leading questions, or socially desirable answers.
 - A leading question is a question that prompts or encourages the desired answer. Perhaps describing a certain outcome as "good" or "bad" or "better" or "worse" can lead the respondent to answer in a certain way.
 - A socially desirable answer is when social factors - like the desire to be accepted or liked - influence the respondent's answer. For example, if you ask someone if they like a certain band, they may say yes because they want to be accepted by the group they are in.
