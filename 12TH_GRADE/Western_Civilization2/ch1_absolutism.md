#### 1.1: Thirty Years' War & The Treaty of Westphalia
 - From 1618 to 1648, a series of conflicts was fought between Roman Catholic and Protestant states, in part to answer the question of what churches European Christians were allowed to attend. These conflicts are known as the Thirty Years' War. This seems like a long time to fight over a fairly minor question, but it was really a major conflict that would drmaatically change the political landscape of Europe.
 - During the sixteenth century, Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation caused Christianity to splinter into numerous sects and subsects. In the Holy Roman Empire, where the Emperor remained a staunch Catholic, members of these sects often had to fight to defend their rights to worship or emigrate to states with princes or monarchs sympathetic to Protestantism. Conflict between the Emperor and an alliance of German princes - named the Schmalkaldic League - that preferred Lutheranism was settled with the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, in which the Emperor Charles V agreed to allow the princes of each state within the Holy Roman Empire to choose either Catholicism or Lutheranism as the religion of their state. This balance was upset by John Calvin's radical preaching(which we know today as Calvinism), which gained more and more following in the middle of the 16th century. 
 - These tensions came to a head in 1618 in the Germanic state of Bohemia. King Matthias of Bohemia, who was also Holy Roman Emperor, had no legitimate heirs and in 1617 named the Archduke of Austria, Ferdinand, heir to the Bohemian throne and likewise put him in line to become Holy Roman Emperor. This alarmed the primarily Calvinist population of Bohemia as Ferdinand was an ardent Catholic. In 1618 the Calvinists revolted, famously by first throwing some of Ferdinand's Catholic advisers out a church window in Prague, an event which became known as the Defenestration of Prague. The Calvinist rebels in Bohemia appealed to the other Protestant states in the Holy Roman Empire for help in throwing off Catholic rule, but their efforts and those of the few allies they found failed; the Bohemians were defeated decisively by Ferdinand - now Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II - in 1620 at the Battle of White Mountain. Fredrick V, the Protestant who they had tried to install, was forced to flee the HRE and Ferdinand II began to consolidate his power.
 - Though the Bohemians and their Protestant allies were defeated, fighting began again in 1625 with Denmark's invasion of the Holy Roman Empire on behalf of the Protestant state of Saxony, which the Danish King Christian IV feared might fall to the Catholic states that encircled it. Christian's invasion proved foolish, and Emperor Ferdinand employed the Bohemian nobleman and brilliant general Albrecht von Wallenstein(think of him similar to Moltke in the 1860s-1880s) to repulse the invaders. The Danes were defeated several times in Germany and in their own territory and retreated to the Danish islands where Wallenstein, who was without a fleet, could not reach the Danish forces. In 1629, Christian IV and Ferdinand II signed the Treaty of LÃ¼beck, which returned previously Danish lands to Denmark in return for a pledge that Denmark would no longer interfere in the affairs of the Empire.
 - At this point, the Thirty Years' War gained a new political dimension: with the consolidation of power in the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor, Ferdinand II, France worried about being surrounded, as the Hapsburg family had members installed as both the King of Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor. Meanwhile, Protestant Sweden worried about the growing Catholic forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and what that would mean for Swedish control of the Baltic Sea. As a result, Sweden landed troops in Pomerania in 1630(and burned a bunch of Prussia as they went) and France and Sweden signed an alliance - despite France being a Catholic country - to aid the Protestant German states. The Swedes scored several victories in the northern and central parts of the Empire, led by their King Gustavus Adolphus, until he died in battle in 1632. After his death, the imperial Catholic forces began to claw back lost territory and in 1635 concluded a peace with the Protestant states of the Holy Roman Empire. The 1635 Treaty of Prague stated that princes of the Holy Roman Empire were not allowed to make alliances and treaties with outside sovereign states and merged the armies of each state within the Holy Roman Empire into one imperial army.
 - The Treaty of Prague angered the French, who quickly realized the Treaty strengthened Hapsburg control over the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire; it was the exact antithesis of the stated French goals for entering the war. As a result, France entered the war directly, declaring war on the Holy Roman Empire in 1636 and on the other Hapsburg-controlled state, Spain, in 1635. The Swedes and several Protestant Germanic states joined the French in continuing the war.
 - After fighting continued, and continued, Ferdinand III(who had taken the throne after his Father's death) sought to finally end the conflict. Over the last several years a series of treaties and ceasefires were signed between France, Spain, Sweden, the Holy Roman Empire, and various Germanic states. These collective agreements became known as the Peace of Westphalia. 
 - Pragmatically, the Peace achieved several things. Some territory changed hands, as France was granted parts of Alsace and Sweden gained part of Pomerania. Calvinists were granted the same degree of toleration in the Holy Roman Empire that Lutherans had been afforded since 1555, and the states of the Holy Roman Empire were granted a greater degree of sovereignty from the imperial throne than they had previously held; indeed, any illusions Emperor Ferdinand III had of retaining strong authority over all of the Holy Roman Empire's provinces and maintaining the Empire as a solely Catholic entity were shattered. 

#### 1.2: Decline of Spain
 - The Seventeenth century saw a decline in Spain's clout and prestige among European and world powers fall, from the heights of being arguably the most powerful state in Europe in the 16th century to a second-rate power by the end of the 17th century. This decline is *still* visible in the modern day with a sub-part industrial sector. Let's take a look at the wider picture, though.
 - It had spent the sixteenth century amassing territories and colonies all along the coasts of the Americas, Africa, and in the south Pacific. Spain expanded its European holdings into parts of southern Italy and, in 1580, Spain successfully invaded its neighbor Portugal, uniting all of the Iberian Peninsula under the Spanish crown. Moreover, in part because of the mines in their South American colonies, Spain had amassed a fortune of gold and silver off of the backs of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.
 - However, Spain's expansion abroad had been completed with little attention paid to the political and social apparatuses at home. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Spain's taxation system was outdated and fell disproportionately upon the poorest of the Spanish population, who could barely afford to pay anything. What money was paid rarely made it to the Spanish Crown, as local governors and councils siphoned off funds for their own expenses.
 - Spain's bureaucracy was as stilted and ineffectual as its tax system. The system was highly centralized, with all territorial councils and ministers reporting directly to the crown, and the pace of seventeenth-century communication made meaningful actions and orders to the far flung provinces of the Empire painfully slow and often outdated upon arrival. Many of these orders were either too specific, which made them difficult to apply to the local situation, or too vague, which made them difficult to apply at all.
 - The Spanish Crown could weather a poor bureaucracy so long as South American gold and silver continued to flow into its coffers. Unfortunately, the amount of bullion shipped to Spain from the Americas dropped precipitously early in the seventeenth century. The Crown was forced to take out loans and even debased the currency in an attempt to pay its bills, but these measures only exacerbated the problems. Many nations had withered away from the resource curse, and Spain was looking like it might be the next.
 - The evaporation of the Spanish treasury occurred at the very moment when it needed money the most: in the midst of foreign wars and internal rebellion. Spain fought to hold on to the rebellious Dutch provinces until they were finally forced to concede defeat in 1648. Spain similarly lost territory to France after two decades of fighting as part of the Thirty Years' War. To make matters worse, Spain had to contend with revolts in both Portugal and Catalonia. The Catalonians failed to gain independence(some are still trying) but Spain was forced to recognize Portuguese independence in 1668.
 - Spain had enough problems in the seventeenth century without being cursed with a succession of ineffectual monarchs. Philip III, who reigned from 1598 to 1621, has been famously dubbed the 'laziest king in Spanish history' and his son Philip IV was no better, caring more for food, horses, and women than governing. Charles II was so mentally challenged, likely because of generations of inbreeding, that Spain's councils and territories were largely left to their own devices. Charles left no heirs when he died in 1700, and his death touched off a war to decide who would become king of Spain.
 - The decline of Spain created a vacuum in European politics that was filled by French, English, and Dutch interests. Whereas Spain suffered under a lack of direction from its royals, France was ruled in the second half of the seventeenth century by arguably the most successful French monarch ever: Louis XIV, the self-named 'Sun King,' who reigned from 1643 to 1715.
 - France was similarly blessed with excellent advisors to the king, as Cardinal Richelieu, Cardinal Mazarin, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert(all of whom had ships named after them!) proved successful politicians and able economists. Under Louis' reign, France expanded its territories in Europe via wars with the Dutch and Spanish. Abroad, France expanded its American holdings from Canada and Louisiana to include most of North America east of the Appalachians and west of the Mississippi River.
 - As well as France, Great Britain and the Netherlands also did much to swipe as much territory and power from the declining Spain as possible. Both benefited from the large economic shift from South American exploitation to North American colonization and trade with the East Indies. The Dutch, in particular, were able to use their naval power to dominate the East Indies trade, which had previously been dominated by the Portuguese and Spanish. The Dutch East India Company was the first multinational corporation in the world, and it was the largest and most powerful company in the world for much of the seventeenth century. The Dutch also established a colony in South Africa, which they used as a way station for ships traveling to and from the East Indies(eventually these would be swiped by the British).

#### 1.3: The Dutch Golden Age
 - Despite their small size and relative lack of natural resources, the fledgling Dutch Republic of the 16th century was so economically powerful and politically relevant, that the time period is often referred to as the Dutch Golden Age.
 - Prior to the Dutch doing much of anything that could qualify as 'golden,' the Dutch first had to gain independence from Habsburg Spain, who ruled over the Dutch provinces. Rebellion was first instigated for religious reasons, as the Dutch provinces were overwhelmingly Protestant, and many favored a radical, Calvinist interpretation of the Bible. In 1568, the Dutch stadtholder, William of Orange, attempted to wrest control of the Dutch provinces from the Spanish but ultimately failed.
 - After fighting, some more fighting, and then a bit more fighting(Sea Beggars, 12 years truce, and then the Thirty Years' War), the Dutch eventually gained independence as the Dutch Republic. 
 - The territory controlled by the Dutch Republic contained few minerals or natural resources, and large portions of its territory were under sea level, prone to flooding if dikes or windmill pumps failed.
 - In response, the Dutch fostered the growth of internal industries, such as textiles, sugar refining and glass blowing. Most importantly, however, the Dutch were accomplished shipwrights and traders. Their traditional boats, called 'fluyts,' could carry more cargo than the average 17th century trading vessel while also requiring a smaller crew.
 - The Dutch further pioneered financial markets as well, first by creating the public Bank of Amsterdam in 1609 to foster investment and further development of trade and industry. The Dutch also created a commodities market where the goods being loaded and shipped on the docks could be traded publicly.
 - The problem was that ship's crews had little incentive to actually go and make money, as they were paid a flat rate regardless of how much money they made for the company. The Dutch East India Company, which was the largest and most powerful company in the world for much of the seventeenth century, solved this problem by offering shares of the company to its employees. This meant that the employees had a vested interest in the success of the company, and the company was able to raise more money by selling shares to the public. Some basic economic theory here, but incentives matter.
 - Domestic and European success encouraged Dutch exploration and colonization abroad. In the Americas, the Dutch traded in slaves and sugar and founded their own colonies, including what is today New York City, which was first settled by Dutch fur traders in the early 17th century. The Dutch expanded their commercial empire into Africa and Southeast Asia as well, done largely by the Dutch East India Company, instituted in 1602. They also founded colonies on Batavia(Jakarta), Ceylon(Sri Lanka), and the Cape of Good Hope(South Africa).
 - Coupled with this economic prosperity abroad, Dutch society and high culture also experienced a remarkable period of success. The Dutch philosopher Spinoza, often considered one of the fathers of modern rationalism, and some of the greatest painters of the early modern period like van Dyck, Rembrandt, Veermeer and Frans Hals were all products of this period.
 - The Dutch Republic also featured a unique societal construction unlike anywhere else in the period. Whereas the rest of European society had power and patronage centralized in the monarchy, the Republic's lack of a monarchy allowed the successful merchant class to become the most powerful and influential members of society.
 - This whole economic sucess story was powered by strong social mobility, as without an aristoracy and the predominance of the merchant class a person could rise from the bottom to the top of society in a single generation. This was a stark contrast to the rest of Europe, where the aristocracy and the monarchy were the most powerful and influential members of society.
