#### 9.1: Advancements in Western Civilization at the End of the 19th Century
 - Mass society is a society that caters to the needs of the majority of the population (the lower classes). During this time, about 80% of Europeans were considered members of this class, which included agricultural workers, urban laborers, and skilled artisans. When a society pays attention to the masses, their living standards go up.
 - Mass leisure is simply any leisure activity that appeals to the majority of the people in a society. Modern examples of this would be going to the beach or to the movies. For the most part, the changes spurred on by the Second Industrial Revolution led to the emergence of a mass society. With extra money to spend, department stores popped up in cities.
 - Widescale literacy, the spread of newspapers, and the rise of public education all contributed to the rise of mass society. The spread of newspapers was particularly important because it allowed for the dissemination of information to the masses. The rise of public education was also important because it allowed for the masses to become more educated. This system has played itself out though, as the system has become more and more bureaucratic and less and less effective.
 - Beginning in 1850, the health of many Europeans improved greatly. Urban reformers spotlighted many societal ills, such as unsanitary cities and unregulated food. Public awareness of these problems led to many changes that increased the population of Europe. For instance, in the years between 1850 and 1910, the European population rose from 270 million to 460 million. Vaccinations were a big part of this, as they helped to prevent diseases that had previously been big killers--especially in young children, and in urban areas.
 - Another social advancement occurred in the fight for women's suffrage, or women's right to vote. The movement for women's suffrage really became a political issue in the 1840s and the 1850s. In Britain, women's movements were in agreement about the importance of gaining this right, but were divided over how best to accomplish their goals. The two prominent groups that emerged were the liberals under the leadership of Millicent Fawcett and the radical group led by Emmeline Pankhurst.
 - While Fawcett advocated peaceful tactics, such as demonstrations, Pankhurst's group engaged in more militant work, such as chaining themselves to lampposts, vandalizing stores, and throwing eggs at members of the government. They were frequently arrested. A small number of states granted women the right to vote before 1914. However, many had to wait until the end of World War I, when women's contributions cemented their place as citizens.

#### 9.2. Third French Republic, Victorian England, Second Reich
 - The Third French Republic began in 1875 and lasted 65 years. When Otto von Bismarck and the Prussian army defeated France in 1870, the Second Empire of Louis Napoleon was over. Bismarck forced the French to elect government representatives by voting. During this time, two parties dominated the government: the monarchists, who advocated the return of a monarchy, and the republicans, who wanted a government based on a constitution and elections. The men of France voted the monarchist party into a majority of the seats in the National Assembly. Having lost most of their political power, the radical republicans formed the Commune, a separate government that operated out of Paris.
 - Seeing this, the National Assembly confronted the Commune with out-right violence. Naturally, the French public chose sides in this conflict. For the most part, workers of both genders sided with the Commune, while National Assembly support mostly came from the upper classes. Interestingly, women played a large part in this conflict. For instance, they took on roles such as feeding and providing medical care to soldiers, performing scouting duties, and even organizing their own combat brigades.
 - In the end, the National Assembly soldiers succeeded in suppressing the Commune. Historians estimate that about 20,000 Commune defenders were killed. This conflict caused lasting political effects in France by creating an emotional division between classes. This conflict, and the histories written of it, would greatly influence socialist/communist thinkers and movements in the future.
 - Queen Victoria ruled England from 1837 to 1901. She was actually only 18 years old when she was crowned queen. But this was not the only unique fact about her. For starters, her reign was so long and prosperous, it is also called the 'Victorian Age.' For such a prominent and imposing leader, she was physically very small, standing at a mere five feet tall!
 - You might also be surprised to learn that she survived seven attempts on her life. Most of those failed assassinations involved attempts at shooting the queen as she rode in her carriage. Amazingly, each time the queen survived, her public popularity rose greatly. Victoria was the first recorded carrier of hemophilia, a disorder where blood does not clot properly. Because so many of her royal descendants were afflicted, the disorder was also called 'the royal disease.'
 - While the period might be named after the queen, the power of the monarch actually declined in favor of a constitutional monarchy, which means that the powers of the monarch are restricted by a constitution. A series of legislation moved most political power into the hands of the voters and those they elected.
 - The Reform Act of 1867 lowered the economic requirements for voting and greatly expanded the number of men who were qualified to vote. This was an important step for working men, who were gradually gaining more political power. Women were still not considered eligible for the right to vote. In 1872, the secret ballot made it unlikely that anyone could bribe or force voters to support a candidate.
 - Her husband, Prince Albert, the King Consort, was actually a German Prince. He was a very influential figure in the British government, and he was responsible for the Great Exhibition of 1851. This was a world's fair that showcased the best of British industry and culture. The exhibition was held in the Crystal Palace, a building made entirely of glass and iron. The Great Exhibition was a huge success, and it was visited by over six million people. In doing so, it helped to promote the idea of free trade and the spread of industrialization.
 - From 1870 to 1871, the Franco-Prussian War was fought. The French were defeated by the Prussians and forced to pay a large indemnity and give up several provinces. The Second German Reich, or empire, was ushered in on January 18, 1871 with the crowning of Wilhelm I as Kaiser, or emperor.
 - This event truly shifted the balance of power in Europe by creating a strong, organized German state. Despite a new authoritarian, or dictatorial, government, the empire had some democratic features as well. One such feature was the Reichstag, or German Parliament, with elected representatives. The Reichstag had the power to amend, accept, or reject legislation. The Bundesrat, or federal council of state deputies, also had a hand in legislation.
 - To help ensure the continued stability of the domestic government, Bismarck embraced a policy of social welfare--as he saw it, bread and butter issues were the best way to keep the people happy. While decreasing immediate discontent, it massively increased government spending and the bureaucratic nature of the government. This policy was also used to keep the Social Democratic Party from gaining too much power, by basically giving them what they wanted. This was Bismarck's greatest struggle, as he was a foreign policy expert, forced into a domestic policy role.
 - He was forced out in 1890, and predicted that 'Europe today is a powder keg, and the leaders today are men smoking in an arsenal.' He was right, as World War I would break out in 1914.

#### 9.5. Science, Art, Philosophy
 - Not everyone was pleased with the changes of industrialized wage labor. In 1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote The Communist Manifesto. It was a call for the working class to establish a utopian planned society of total equality. It was, in fact, quite dumb. See Independent Study, Case Study 4.3
 - Advances in science, particularly during the 19th century, changed the way people viewed the world. In 1859, Charles Darwin published On the Origin of the Species by Means of Natural Selection.
 - In his book, he presented his idea of natural selection. In other words, he believed that plants and animals evolved over time through organic evolution. According to this theory, animals produced more offspring than could survive. The offspring that survived did so because they possessed traits that gave them the best chance for survival. We can understand this better by picturing two birds. One bird has bright yellow feathers that make it clearly visible, while the other has brown feathers that easily blend in with tree bark. Which bird will likely be found by any predators? It would probably be the yellow one. So according to Darwin, the desirable trait of the brown feathers would continue to be produced because that bird survived to have offspring. This idea is also known as the survival of the fittest.
 - Right on the money, right? Well, not so much once he started applying it to people. In human traits, yes - but in human society, no. This is because humans have the ability to change their environment, and thus their own evolution to a greater extent than any other species due to our intelligence.
 - In another important breakthrough, scientists Pierre and Marie Curie discovered that the element radium emitted radiation from within the atom itself in 1898. According to this research, atoms were not simply hard material but microscopic worlds containing subatomic particles.
 - Science was not the only area to undergo a shift during this time. The world of art was changing as well. Beginning in 1850, Realism began to emerge as the preferred method of painting.
 - This style focused on depicting everyday people and events, such as farmers tending their fields or families gathered around a dinner table. This style was also marked by an attempt at photographic realism and a focus on nature.
 - Two influential Realists were Gustave Courbet and Jean-Francois Millet. Courbet's paintings depicted subjects such as factory workers and everyday women. According to Courbet, 'I have never seen either angels or goddesses, so I am not interested in painting them.' Millet painted mostly rural scenes, such as peasants harvesting their fields. His most famous work was 'The Gleaners', a depiction of three women working in a field.
 - During this time, the idea of Materialism became dominant. Adherents to Materialism believe that everything, even human thoughts and emotions, is the result of physical forces and properties. Friedrich Nietzsche, who lived from 1844 until 1900, was among the most influential philosophers of the period. 
 - In the Study.com lesson here, it says `He advocated the irrational, meaning that he believed that reason had little influence on human events. Rather, he insisted that humanity was at the mercy of irrational forces. He attacked Christianity, blaming religion for destroying the human will. For Nietzsche, both God and Christianity must be eliminated from society in order to progress. His ideas would influence the attack against Christianity we will talk about next.`
 - This is, to put it simply, a load of crap. Some parts of this are true in the most limited sense, but miss the full context. Nietzsche was worried about the rise of Nihilism in society - the belief that nothing has any value. Without a value system, society had no foundation or reason to value anything. Nietzsche *was* a critic of Christianity, but not because he thought it was destroying the human will. He thought it was destroying the human spirit. He believed that Christianity was a slave morality, that it was a religion of the weak, but he did give it credit in that it *WAS* a value system -- the same reason that he gave the Stoics credit, despite having differneces with them. Nietzsche believed that the only way to progress was to create a new value system, one that was based on the idea of the Ubermensch, that one could rise above the herd mentality and create their own values. He believed that every individual, ideally, should replace an enforced, coerced value system with one of their own creation and consideration. This is a very different idea than the one presented in the lesson.
