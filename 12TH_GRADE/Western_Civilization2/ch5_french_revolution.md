### Chapter 5: The French Revolution

#### Causes of the French Revolution
 - In the 17th and early 18th centuries, France was at the height of its European power. The 'Sun King,' Louis XIV, had expanded French possessions eastward into Central Europe and huge swathes of North America, from Canada to Louisiana, were under French control. This empire and the wars, which acquiring such expansive territory required, however, came with an enormous bill. When Louis XIV died in 1715, he left the French state wracked with massive debt.
 - Successive rulers had to spend ever more money trying to hold on to possessions of, admittedly, dubious value. French North America, while huge, was sparsely populated, difficult to defend, and not particularly profitable.  Their subsequent participation in the successful American Revolution further drained money from the French state, while achieving little tangible results for France other than the humiliation of their chief Western European rival, Great Britain. Benjamin Franklin and the American Revolutionaries had been able to secure French support by promising to pay back the French state for its assistance, but the new American government was in no position to do so. The French state was left holding the bag, pretty much on a street corner in Amsterdam, begging for money.
 - The money to pay for the spendthrift practices of France's rulers, both at home and abroad, had to be paid for by someone, and much of this money came from taxes. In 18th-century France, the nobility and the church were both exempt from taxation, which meant that nearly all tax money came from the incomes of the poorest - and most populous - portion of French society. This was made worse by the crop failures and subsequent famines that struck France. 
 - In 1781, Jaques Necker--a Swiss financial wizard--published the widely extolled *Compte Rendu*, the first ever public accounting of the French state's finances. The *Compte Rendu* showed that the French State was running a massive *surplus*, which helped to gain support of Bankers(lending the state more money), but when the time for actual reforms to fix the massive REAL deficit came, everyone just pointed at the *Compte Rendu* and said "See? We're doing fine!" This was not the case, and the French state was in a very bad way.
 - What Necker's *Compte Rendu* did do, however, was hide the "Extraordinary Expenses" that the French state was incurring.
