#### I. Introduction
In my opinion, the steam engine is the second most important invention in human history. The only thing that surprasses it is the printing press, for its unparalleled ability to perpetuate and spread the ideas of human civilization. However, the steam engine was the first human creation that allowed humanity to harness nature in a fundamentally new way - not just an improvement on nature, a fundamental change in the way humans interacted with the world. The steam engine was the first machine that allowed an exponential increase in human productivity, instead of just a linear increase(even if a very steep linear increase like water wheels), allowing for a new era of human history - the Industrial Revolution.

#### II. Who Invented the Steam Engine?

The steam engine was not a one-from-nothing stroke of genius, but rather a series of incremental improvements on a basic principle. The first thing that could be called a steam engine was the Aeolipile, invented by Hero(or Heron, depending on the source) of Alexandria in the 1st century AD. We only know of it because Vitruvius, a Roman architect, included it in his foundational book "De Architectura". The Aeolipile was a simple device, a sphere with two nozzles on opposite sides, mounted on a pivot. When the sphere, filled with water, was heated, steam would escape from the nozzles, causing the sphere to spin. While technically a steam engine, it was not practical for a number of reasons, foremost of which was that it was never actually seen as something that could be used for work, and was instead seen as a curiosity. It soon faded into obscurity, and something like it was not seen(or recorded) again for more than a millennium.

The first practical steam engine was invented by a British engineer named Thomas Savery in 1698. Savery's engine was simple, and only midly effective, but had the true parts of a steam engine as we know it today - a boiler and an isolated steam tank. The vacuum created by the condensation of steam in the tank(after shutting it off from the boiler) would draw water up from a well, or more commonly, from a mine. While it had practical applications, and was far more powerful than horse-driven pumps, it was not very efficient and was prone to explosions. It was also not very powerful, and was only used in very specific applications. Still, it was the first time that steam was used to do truly useful work, and set the stage for the next major development.

This next major development did not have to wait long, as in 1712 Thomas Newcomen, another British engineer, invented the atmospheric engine, which could give continuous(though not very powerful in its initial versions) power to a machine, though I have found no records of it being used in this way. His version of the steam engine improved on Savery's by adding a piston, under which vacuum would be created that could draw water in a pumping application. This used steam at atmospheric pressure instead of high-pressure, dramatically decreasing the explosion risk. This engine was used widely in mines to pump water out, allowing mining to go far deeper than ever before and increasing the yields of mines significantly. The major flaw, that which would inspire the next major development, was that the cylinder was totally cooled and then reheated with every stroke, dramatically decreasing efficiency and effectiveness.

James Watt is *the* name that comes to mind when one thinks of the steam engine, and for good reason - he made the engine(or design/style of it) that changed the world. The story of how he came to be working on steam engines, and how he came to the expertise that allowed him to do so, is a fascinating one, but outside the scope of this exploration. To summarize, Watt was a Scottish instrument maker who was asked to repair a Newcomen engine in 1763 for the University of Glasgow, where he was working as the official Mathematical Instrument Maker. This engine had never run for long, and the faculty wanted to see if he could fix it. Watt figured out what the problem was fairly quickly, the cylinder of the engine cooled down with every stroke due to the condensation of steam, and had to be reheated by some amount before the next. It took almost a year for him to find the solution, but he eventually did - a separate condenser, which would keep the cylinder hot and the condenser cold, allowing for a dramatically more efficient cycle. Developing the engine was too expensive for Watt himself, so he sold a large share to a speculator named John Roebuck, who then made poor business decisions and sold it to a man named Matthew Boulton, a semi-successful manufacturer who saw in Watt's engine an enormous potential for increasing the power of civilization. Watt's engine, even in its first form, at least doubled the power of Newcomen's and cut down on fuel cost significantly. It was also far more versatile, and could be used for a wide variety of applications, from pumping water to powering mills to driving locomotives. Watt's engine was the first to be used in a wide variety of applications, and was droven forward a new technological era.

So to answer the question of who invented the steam engine, Hero of Alexandria - but that answer is not at all satisfying. The first practical steam engine was invented by Savery, the first widely used one by Newcomen, and the one that lit the spark on the greatest expansion of human wealth and control over nature in history was invented by Watt. All deserve their own credit for their contributions, they stood on the shoulders of their predecessors and were in turn stood on by their successors. 

#### III. What made the steam engine so important?

> "Science owes more to the steam engine than the steam engine owes to science." - Lawrence Joseph Henderson 

The energy wealth--that fundamental currency of civilization--of humanity was never more increased by a single technology or innovation than by the steam engine. While the atomic age allowed for--even if not properly utilized to this day--a far greater amount of energy to be harnessed in absolute terms, the percentage increase in energy wealth was far greater with the steam engine. Before the steam engine, the only sources of non animal/human power were water and wind, and both of these were only practicable in extremely limited geographic areas. The steam engine could be used anywhere, and was not limited by the weather, the time of day, or the season. Give it coal or wood, and you had more power than anything else in history. This is not hyperbole, according to [www.encyclopedie-energie.org](https://arc.net/l/quote/dsmqgmim), in 1800 the world consumption of energy(in MTOE, or million tons of oil equivalent) was 305 - 7 from coal, 298 from traditional biomass: wood, charcoal, manure. Note that this does not include the energy from wind or water, but that does not change the fundamental point. By 2000, the world consumption of energy was 9,242 MTOE, and has continued to accelerate to near 15,000 MTOE today.

Without the steam engine, this unbelievable increase in energy wealth--a measure near-directly tied to human prosperity--would have been impossible. Even today, with all of the advances in technology and energy generation, in oil, natural gas, and nuclear power, they still spin steam turbines to generate electricity, effectively an incredibly advances and efficient version of the original technology. More than that, as a singular technology it led to the industrial revolution, which itself was a proliferation of technologies and innovations that compounded on each other, leading to the world we live in today. Just look at these two graphs:

![GDP Straight Line](https://humanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Most-Important-Graph-1.jpg)
![Global Primary Energy Consumption](global-primary-energy.png)

In both graphs, human wealth and energy consumption were relatively constant for most of human history--asymptoting near zero--and then the industrial revolution hit, caused by the steam engine, and both skyrocketed. While the most common criticism of these graphs is that they are either cherry-picked, which is demonstrably false just by looking at the pre-industrial revolution part of the first graph, or that the increase in wealth and energy consumption is a bad thing, leading to pollution and climate change, which is illogical for two main reasons. The first is that the increase in energy wealth has led to the greatest growth of human prosperity, population, and life expectancy in human history, and the second that is climate change is a *luxury* problem, the good kind that only comes from being so prosperous that you might actually be able to have it happen to you. This doesn't deny the negative effects of climate change, but the same industry that brought us to this point, dealing with climate change as a result of gigantic prosperity is inevitably the same industry and prosperity that will solve it. It is a technical problem, and much like Watt and his condenser, we will find a solution.

#### IV. Conclusion

This is in no way an exhaustive exploration of the steam engine, nor was it meant to be. I would gladly spend a decade writing about the development and impacts of the steam engine, but for this limited scope I hope to have provided a brief but comprehensive understanding of the steam engine and its impacts, and why we all owe it, and its inventors, a debt of gratitude. The society we live in today, the civilization our species has created, is intimately tied to this single invention, a token of human genius and ingenuity, and a testament to the power of human industry and the human mind. The steam engine, and the industrial revolution it sparked, is the most important event in human history, and the single greatest driver of human prosperity and wealth.
