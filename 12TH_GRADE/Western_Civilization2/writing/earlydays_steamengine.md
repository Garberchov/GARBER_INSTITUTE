#### I. Introduction
In my opinion, the steam engine is the second most important invention in human history. The only thing that surprasses it is the printing press, for its unparalleled ability to perpetuate and spread the ideas of human civilization. However, the steam engine was the first human creation that allowed humanity to harness nature in a fundamentally new way - not just an improvement on nature, a fundamental change in the way humans interacted with the world. The steam engine was the first machine that allowed an exponential increase in human productivity, instead of just a linear increase(even if a very steep linear increase like water wheels), allowing for a new era of human history - the Industrial Revolution.

#### II. Who Invented the Steam Engine?

The steam engine was not a one-from-nothing stroke of genius, but rather a series of incremental improvements on a basic principle. The first thing that could be called a steam engine was the Aeolipile, invented by Hero(or Heron, depending on the source) of Alexandria in the 1st century AD. We only know of it because Vitruvius, a Roman architect, included it in his foundational book "De Architectura". The Aeolipile was a simple device, a sphere with two nozzles on opposite sides, mounted on a pivot. When the sphere, filled with water, was heated, steam would escape from the nozzles, causing the sphere to spin. While technically a steam engine, it was not practical for a number of reasons, foremost of which was that it was never actually seen as something that could be used for work, and was instead seen as a curiosity. It soon faded into obscurity, and something like it was not seen(or recorded) again for more than a millennium.

The first practical steam engine was invented by a British engineer named Thomas Savery in 1698. Savery's engine was simple, and only midly effective, but had the true parts of a steam engine as we know it today - a boiler and an isolated steam tank. The vacuum created by the condensation of steam in the tank(after shutting it off from the boiler) would draw water up from a well, or more commonly, from a mine. While it had practical applications, and was far more powerful than horse-driven pumps, it was not very efficient and was prone to explosions. It was also not very powerful, and was only used in very specific applications. Still, it was the first time that steam was used to do truly useful work, and set the stage for the next major development.

This next major development did not have to wait long, as in 1712 Thomas Newcomen, another British engineer, invented the atmospheric engine, which could give continuous(though not very powerful in its initial versions) power to a machine, though I have found no records of it being used in this way. His version of the steam engine improved on Savery's by adding a piston, under which vacuum would be created that could draw water in a pumping application. This used steam at atmospheric pressure instead of high-pressure, dramatically decreasing the explosion risk. This engine was used widely in mines to pump water out, allowing mining to go far deeper than ever before and increasing the yields of mines significantly. The major flaw, that which would inspire the next major development, was that the cylinder was totally cooled and then reheated with every stroke, dramatically decreasing efficiency and effectiveness.

James Watt is *the* name that comes to mind when one thinks of the steam engine, and for good reason - he made the engine(or design/style of it) that changed the world. The story of how he came to be working on steam engines, and how he came to the expertise that allowed him to do so, is a fascinating one, but outside the scope of this exploration. To summarize, Watt was a Scottish instrument maker who was asked to repair a Newcomen engine in 1763 for the University of Glasgow, where he was working as the official Mathematical Instrument Maker. This engine had never run for long, and the faculty wanted to see if he could fix it. Watt figured out what the problem was fairly quickly, the cylinder of the engine cooled down with every stroke due to the condensation of steam, and had to be reheated by some amount before the next. It took almost a year for him to find the solution, but he eventually did - a separate condenser, which would keep the cylinder hot and the condenser cold, allowing for a dramatically more efficient cycle. Developing the engine was too expensive for Watt himself, so he sold a large share to a speculator named John Roebuck, who then made poor business decisions and sold it to a man named Matthew Boulton, a semi-successful manufacturer who saw in Watt's engine an enormous potential for increasing the power of civilization. Watt's engine, even in its first form, at least doubled the power of Newcomen's and cut down on fuel cost significantly. It was also far more versatile, and could be used for a wide variety of applications, from pumping water to powering mills to driving locomotives. Watt's engine was the first to be used in a wide variety of applications, and was droven forward a new technological era.

So to answer the question of who invented the steam engine, Hero of Alexandria - but that answer is not at all satisfying. The first practical steam engine was invented by Savery, the first widely used one by Newcomen, and the one that lit the spark on the greatest expansion of human wealth and control over nature in history was invented by Watt. All deserve their own credit for their contributions, they stood on the shoulders of their predecessors and were in turn stood on by their successors. 

#### III. What made the steam engine so important?

> "Science owes more to the steam engine than the steam engine owes to science." - Lawrence Joseph Henderson

The energy wealth--that fundamental currency of civilization--of humanity was never more increased by a single technology or innovation than by the steam engine.
