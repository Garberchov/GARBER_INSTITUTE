# Chapter 7
 - Franz Anton Mesmer was the real founder of hypnosis as a medical technique.
 - Mesmer believed that the body was filled with a magnetic fluid that could be manipulated by magnets, though most of his actual healing was done by suggestion.
 - Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness in which people respond to suggestions and behave as though they are in a trance, it is both sleep and wakefulness at the same time.
 - Hypnosis is real, it has been empirically proven to exist and to work, but it is not a cure-all nor a miracle drug.
 - The real mechanisms of hypnosis are generally unknown and are commonly debated.
 - Drugs are a common way to get the kind of altered state of consciousness that hypnosis also does, though in the case of drugs it is not a trance but a genuine physiological change to the functions of the brain.
 - Brains are really good at adapting to things, so drugs end up being less effective over time due to an increased tolerance.
 - Drugs are also TERRIBLE for you, and should be avoided.
 - Depressants are drugs that slow down the nervous system, and include alcohol, tranquilizers, and opiates(different from opioids).
 - Depressants are EXTREMELY common, just look at the social acceptance of alcohol - it is by definition a drug. 
 - Alchol is known to "stimulate" a party, because it is a disinhibitor, it makes people less likely to use their judgement.
 - Stimulants are drugs that speed up the nervous system, and include caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine. 
 - Hallucinogens are drugs that cause hallucinations, and include LSD, marijuana, and PCP.
 - They distort perceptions and evoke sensory images in the absence of sensory input. 

# Chapter 8
 - Sensation is the process of detecting stimulus and converting it into neural signals.
 - Our five major senses are vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.
 - Perception is the identification and interpretation of sensory information. In a philosophical sense, it is the process of attaining awareness or understanding of sensory information - and should be trusted only as far as it can be verified through the use of our logic and reason.
 - The Absolute Threshold is the minimum amount of stimulus to cause a sensation.
 - The Just Noticeable Difference is the minimum amount of change in a stimulus to cause a sensation.
 - Sensory Adaptation is the process of a sensory receptor cell becoming less responsive to a stimulus that is unchanging, after it is very common over a period of time. This can be really well seen in dopamine receptors.
