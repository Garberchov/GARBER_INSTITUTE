### Chapter 9 and 10 Notes

## Chapter 9
 - An unconditioned stimulus is a stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response.
 - An unconditioned response is an unlearned, naturally occurring response to an unconditioned stimulus.
 - A conditioned stimulus is an unrelated stimulus that, after being associated with an unconditioned stimulus, triggers a specific response.
 - A conditioned response is a learned response to a previously unrelated stimulus.
 - We get most of this from Pavlov's dog experiment, where he rang a bell before feeding the dog, and eventually the dog would salivate at the sound of the bell.
 - This is called classical conditioning, and it is a type of learning in which one learns(or is taught) to link two or more stimuli to specific events.
 - Operant conditioning is a type of learning in which a voluntary response is strengthened or weakened, depending on its pleasantness or unpleasantness.
 - Reinforcement and punishment are the two main ways to strengthen or weaken a response - in this case, positive is just the addition of a stimulus, and negative is the removal of a stimulus.

## Chapter 10
 - Memories are not random, they have scientific explanations.
 - Encoding is the process of putting information into memory.
 - Storage is the process of keeping information in memory.
 - Retrieval is the process of getting information out of memory.
 - Sound a lot like how a computer works - well, yeah.
 - Memory is an active system that receives information from the senses, organizes and alters it, and then retrieves it when needed.
 - Encoding is a set of mental operations that people perform on sensory information to convert that information into a form that is usable in the brain's storage systems.
 - Storage is the process of holding onto information for some period of time.
 - Retrieval is getting information that is in storage into a form that can be used.
