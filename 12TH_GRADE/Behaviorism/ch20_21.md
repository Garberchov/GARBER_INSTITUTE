### Chapter 20-21 Notes

## Chapter 20 - Attitudes and Social Behaviors
 - Attitudes are learned tendencies to evaluate things in a certain way - they are lenses through which we view the world. This is another one of the brain's shortcuts to save energy when making decisions.
 - There are three major components of attitudes:
   - Affective component: feelings or emotions about the object, person, or event
   - Behavioral component: the effect of the attitude on behavior (the action that a person takes in regard to the person, object, or situation). If you see a spider, you might scream and run away.
   - Cognitive component: beliefs, thoughts, and or knowledge about the object of the attitude. You might think that spiders are dangerous and should be avoided.
