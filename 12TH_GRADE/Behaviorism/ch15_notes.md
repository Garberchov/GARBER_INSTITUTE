### Chapter 15 Notes
 - We spend too much of our time being tossed around by the waves of our emotions, and learning to control, rationally analyze, and understand our emotions is a key part of becoming a better person.
 - Botox can apparently help regulate emotions by preventing the facial muscles from expressing emotions, which prevents the brain from feeling those emotions.
 - Introverts are more able to see other people's emotions, extroverts are more able to express their own emotions.
 - These two terms have gotten wildly misused in the past few years, and introversion is not the same as shyness or lack of desire for widescale social interaction.
 - Desiring minimal, but highly meaningful social interaction has gotten the coloquial label of introversion, but this is not the same as the psychological definition of introversion.
 - There are 10 basic emotions: joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, shame, guilt, and interest/excitement.
 - Humans, due to our internal perspective - we are capable of thinking about our own thoughts - have a tendency to overestimate the length, intensity, and frequency of negative emotions and underestimate our ability to cope with them.
 - Stress is deeply harmful to health, and can cause a wide variety of health problems.
 - Stress is defined as the way we perceive and respond to certain events, called stressors, that we appraise as threatening or challenging.
 - The MOST important thing in that definition is *appraise*, philosophically said, if we do not acceed to the impression of the stressor, it is not a stressor, we are not stressed.
 - Chronic stress is the most harmful, and is caused by long-term stressors, such as poverty, being in a bad relationship, or being in a bad job, and leads to a higher rate of digestive, respiratory, and heart problems. 
 - The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that controls the automatic functions of the body, such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion, and stress causes it to divert blood from the digestive system to the muscles, which is why we feel sick when we are stressed.
 - Pessimist and depression are linked to heart disease, and optimists are more likely to live longer. Simply stated, an optimistic outlook decreases stress, and stress is bad for your health, therefore, optimism is good for your health. (Aristotle would be proud of this syllogism)
