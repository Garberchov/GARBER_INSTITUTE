### Introducing Psychology

#### Goal of Notes:
 - Take notes on things that:
    - Give new knowledge
    - Interesting and/or eye-catching
    - Very important to share and discuss
    - Things that I want to remember for my own personal use

### Introducing Psychology:
 - Psychological principles allow us to understand ourselves, our interactions with others, and our place in the world around us(to a certain extent, that is a philosophical question in large part).
 - Behaviors can be analyzed through the lens of psychology, and this can help us understand why we do what we do(again, to a certain extent).
 - Modern psychology began in Leipzig, Germany in 1879, when Wilhelm Wundt opened the first psychology laboratory, though the study of psychology has been around for much longer. Most notably the Ancient Greeks, after studying behavior, concluded that humans were rational beings, not puppets of the gods(though some Greek philosophers did believe in the gods, they did not believe that the gods controlled their every action. The Stoics, known for being deterministic, believed that unbreakable chains of cause and effect controlled everything, and that the gods were the starts of these chains, but that humans were still rational beings, and that they could still make choices, even if the reason they made those choices was predetermined by fate).
 - Rene Descartes was against the concept of Dualism, that the mind and body are separate, he believed that the movements, sensations, and most notably, perceptions, were controlled by the mind.
 - Back to Leipzig, and Wilhelm Wundt, he developed a method called introspection, which is the process of looking inward to examine one's own conscious experience and then reporting that experience. While not entirely accurate, and filled with the biases inherent to the human condiiton, it was the first step towards a scientific study of psychology.
 - Modern Psychoanalytic philosophy can be largely credited to Sigmund Freud, who believed that the unconcious mind held far greater depths than that of the concious mind. He believed that our concious experiences are only the tip of the iceberg, and primitive biological urges deep in our unconcious mind that run in conflict with societal expectations are the cause of much of human discontent(I'm sure that Nietzsche would have something to say about that, but I digress).
 - Humanistic philosophy focused on the idea that human nature is evolving, self-directed, and largely self-actualizing. This belief means that humans are not controlled by either their unconcious mind, or the environment around them, but rather by the development of their rational faculties(similar to what would later be known as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT).
 - Sociocultural Psychology is a newer field of psychology that focuses on the influence that ethnicity, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status have on our behaivor - though I thonk that this verges into the philosophy of language, quite a bit.
