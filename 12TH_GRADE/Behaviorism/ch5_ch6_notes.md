### Chapter 5 and 6 Notes

 - Early/Middle adulthood is often centered around career, and then a consideration of whether career is valuable or not. When career is not valuable, it is either replace with family or vices.
 - Marriage/Children/Family is a common theme in this stage of life, though divorce rates are increasing(for a variety of reasons).
 - Women, despite almost 75% of them working, still do most of the housework and childcare. I think this is deeply unfair, despite its systemic roots(and perhaps marginally balanced out by Men doing more home repair and improvement work, though not a real balanced amount of time).
 - In late adulthood, the body simply begins to fail. There are two main theories of why, genetic programming and wear and tear. The wear and tear seems "simpler", but might be a correlation rather than causation - I actually hope the genetic programming is the cause, because that means we can fix it. The wear and tear would require us to implant a lot of new parts(become Androids, more or less, which is cool, but keeping a regular human body is probably preferable).
 - Cognitive decline in late adulthood is also an unfortunate fact of life, though it is not as severe as it is often portrayed. I think it is portrayed more dramatically due to increased PHYSICAL difficulty in communicating, rather than mental difficulty. 
 - Memory loss is not universal, though the neural processing speed does decline with age. 
 - There is a disengagement theory, which states that older people withdraw from society because they are preparing for death. I think this is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, and that the elderly should be encouraged to stay active and engaged in society - though part of this is that they are a financial burden on families who do not have the resources to care for them, and so they are often put in nursing homes.
 - Elisabeth Kubler-Ross has a 5 stage theory of tragedy/death, which is Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. I think this is a good model, though assuming it is functionally linear is probably overstating it. Also, it doesn't leave much room for people to just *not* feel grief over it, either through philosophical training or just a lack of emotional attachment to the person who died(or themselves dying).

 - There is significant chemical change in the brain during adolescense, though this being attributed as the reason for moody teenagers is overly simplistic. As Paul Graham says in "Hackers and Painters", the reason teenagers are moody is because they desire purpose, and are not given any - teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were not moody, they might be rowdy, but they had purpose they could guide their energy towards.
 - The neuron are the building blocks of the brain, and they are connected by synapses. 
 - In economic terms(shoutout to Hayek), they are self-organizing, and the aims of the individual neurons are not the aims of the brain as a whole. 
 - There are multiple kinds of neurons, bipolar(interneurons), unipolar(sensory neurons), and multipolar(motor neurons), and pyramid neurons. 
 - There are three parts to a neuron, the dendrites, the cell body, and the axon. The dendrites receive signals, the cell body processes them, and the axon transmits them.
 - The myelin sheeth is a fatty substance that coats the axon, and allows for faster transmission of signals, and if it degrades, the signals are degraded. The most common cause of its degradation is Multiple Sclerosis(shoutout Jed Bartlet).
 - Synapses are the connections between neurons, and they are the primary way that neurons communicate.
 - There are chemical connections that jump the synaptic gap, and they are called neurotransmitters.
 - There are two kinds of neurotransmitters, excitatory and inhibitory. Excitatory neurotransmitters increase the likelihood of the neuron firing, and inhibitory neurotransmitters decrease the likelihood of the neuron firing.
 - They have many functions, like Endorphins, Serotonin, Dopamine, and Acetylcholine, and they are all important for different reasons.
 - ** I agree with the fundamental premise that everything Psychological is Biological, though that does not mean it is the CAUSE, it is perhaps a reflection in some instances of the unqiue character of an individual. **
 - Hormones are chemical messages that are made in the endocrine glands, and travel through the bloodstream.
 - Hormones do things like regulate growth, metabolism, sexual development, mood, hunger, stress(in some cases), sleep, and aggression.
 - Nervous and Endocrine systems are closely related, though they work at very different speeds.
 - Hormones are just objectively slower than neurons, and so they are not as good for quick responses, but they can control the body for longer periods of time.
 - Adrenal glands are the glands that produce adrenaline, and they are located on top of the kidneys. 
 - The pancreas regulates blood sugar, and the thyroid regulates metabolism.
 - Testicles regulate testosterone, and ovaries regulate estrogen.
 - The pituitary gland is the master gland, and it regulates the other glands. It is kind of the super master gland, and it regulates oxytocin and growth hormones.
