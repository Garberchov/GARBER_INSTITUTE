## Chapter 13: Psychological Testing
 - The words assessment and testing are used interchangeably in regular parlance, but in psychology it is important to differentiate between the two.
 - Assessment is defined as the gathering and integration of psychology-related data for the purpose of making a psychological evaluation. it frequently includes the use of tests, interviews, and/or observation procedures.
 - Testing is the process of measuring psychology related variables by means of devices or procedures designed to obtain a sample of behavior.
 - Testing is just for one variable, while assessment is for a borader goal.
 - Testing can be done one-on-one, in a group, or by a computer, while assessment is almost done one-on-one.
 - Some assumptions have to made for assessment to exist at all, including that Psychological states and traits exist, and that they can be observed and measured. In addition, it has to be assumed that test-related behavior predicts non-test behavior. Also, it has to be assumed that tests have strengths and weaknesses, and that test scores are influenced by a variety of factors. In this, there are errors of measurement. In addiition, it has to be assumed that tests and other assessment techniques can be used in an ethical manner. Finally, it has to be assumed that testing and assessment can benefit society.
 - There are several ways to analyze test scores:
    - Theoretical Orientation: Theory works as both a foundation and a lens to analyze results.
    - Practical Considerations: Bias from the structure of the test and its effect on the test taker can be considered.
    - Standardization: How much the test taker's score deviates from the norm can be considered.
    - Reliability: The consistency of the test can be considered, if it is extremely non-reliable, it is not a good test.
    - Validity: The accuracy of the test can be considered, if it actually measures what it is supposed to measure.


## Chapter 14: measuring personality
 - There are no shortage of ways to measure personality, from traditional spiritual theories to Freudian theories about Id, Ego, and Superego, to Meyer-Briggs, to the Big Five, to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and many more.
 - The "self" is generally defined as the center of our experience, actions, and characteristics. It can be measured internally, or from an external perspective(or by an external observer).
 - There are two main 20th centuries theories, the trait and social cognitive theories.
 - Trait theory is more about personality being measured through stable and lasting behavior patterns and concious motivations. 
 - Trait theory can be categorized into the big five personality traits, which are openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. All of these are on a spectrum, and are not binary.
 - These traits are thought to be predictive of behavior, based on previous behavior. These are also thought to be more of an "average" of behavior, rather than a specific behavior.
 - Social cognitive theory is more about personality being measured through the interaction of the person and their environment. The theory is that people model and modify their behavior based on their environment.
 - Personal control is a big factor in social cognitive theory, it is the extent to which you *believe* you have control over your environment. Not if you actually do, but if you believe you do(the Stoics would say that you ALWAYS have control over your environment, but that is a different topic. Shoutout Epictetus, he seems to come up a lot. Funny, that.).
 - The psychodynamic school of thought has more recently adopted the thematic apperception test, to measure personality. It is a test where the test taker is shown a picture, and asked to tell a story about it. The idea is that the story will reveal the test taker's personality - their motivations, fears, and desires.
 - Personality trait inventories are kind of the opposite of the psychodynamic camp, in that they are more about the test taker's self-reporting of their personality. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is the most widely used personality inventory, and it is used to diagnose mental disorders. Also popular and widely used in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which is based on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types. It is used to measure personality types, and is used in career counseling, team building, and leadership training. I have taken this a number of times, I am an INTJ(to the surprise of no one, I am sure).
 - The social cognitive measurement camp is more about explaining contexts based on anecodtal evidence, rather than measuring personality. It is more about explaining why people act the way they do, rather than measuring their personality.
 - The humanistic camp is somewhat similar to this, in that they aren't much for testing and are more focused on interviews, therapy, and other qualitative measures of self.
