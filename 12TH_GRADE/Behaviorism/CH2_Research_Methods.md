### Psychological Research Methods

#### Goal of Notes:
 - Take notes on things that:
    - Give new knowledge
    - Interesting and/or eye-catching
    - Very important to share and discuss
    - Things that I want to remember for my own personal use

#### Psychological Research Methods
 - To gain information of subjects when they are not conscious of being observed during an experiment. To obtain such information, a psychologist uses naturalistic observation. The cardinal rule of naturalistic observation is to avoid disturbing the people or animals you are studying by concealing yourself or by acting as unobtrusively as possible. 
 - A case study is an intensive study of a person or group. Most case studies combine long-term observations with diaries, tests, and interviews. Case studies can be a powerful research tool.
 - One of the most practical ways to gather data on the attitudes, beliefs, and experiences of large numbers of people is through surveys. A survey may consist of interviews, questionnaires, or a combination of the two. Interviews allow a researcher to observe the participant and modify questions if the participant seems confused by them. On the other hand, questionnaires take less time to administer and the results are more uniform because everyone answers the same questions.
 - When conducting longitudinal studies, a psychologist studies the same group of people at regular intervals over a period of years to determine whether their behavior and/or feelings have changed and if so, how. Longitudinal studies are time-consuming and precarious; participants may disappear in midstudy. Longitudinal studies, however, are an ideal way to examine consistencies and inconsistencies in behavior over time.
 - Correlations are simply relationships between two sets of data or variables. 
 - However, correlation does not prove causation.
 - Ethical principles must be observed during any kind of psychological research. This makes things like the Stanford Prison Experiment impossible to replicate(which is a good thing, because that experiment did real damage to the participants).
 - In the statistical use of data, it is generally more important to measure for centrality(mean, median, mode) than it is to measure for variability(range, standard deviation, variance). This is because outliers are generally just that, outliers, and they do not represent the majority of the data(this is not always the case, and a lack of studies that *focus on* on outliers seems to be a problem in the field of psychology, but that is a discussion for another time).
