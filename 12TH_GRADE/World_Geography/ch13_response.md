The modern European economy is one of great trichotomy. The Black Earth belt of Ukraine and much of Eastern Europe is hugely fertile, and produces large quantities of agricultural surplus for export. The central European manufacturing center is the hub of some extremely advanced industrial firms, with Germany, Poland, Sweden, France, Italy, and others being world leading in some fields. Finally, Europe is also a leading service economy, with the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, and others being world leaders in finance, banking, and other services. This trichotomy is the result of a long history of European economic development, and is the result of a variety of factors, most notably, geography.

The effect of geography on agriculture isn't hard to see, Europe as a whole is largely mild in weather with rich soil - the South being extremely well suited to growing olives, grapes, and other Mediterranean crops, with the Central, North, and most notably Eastern regions being well suited for barley, wheat, corn, and potatoes. This isn't to say that Europe is a perfect agricultural paradise, Scandanavia is far too cold for supporting really large populations on the scale of the rest of Europe, and the Mediterranean is too dry and too mountainous to support large-scale row-crop agriculture. However, each region of Europe has found a niche in which it can produce a large agricultural surplus, and this has allowed Europe to become a major agricultural exporter.

The effect of geography on industry is even less subtle: Europe has lots of natural resources. Coal, Iron, Copper, Zinc, Lumber, and many more resources are well concentrated in the comparatively small area of Europe, and the wide array of navigable rivers make it easy to transport these resources to the centers of industry. It is no coincidence that the industrial centers of Europe are located in the Ruhr Valley, the Po Valley, and the Thames Valley, all of which are located in the heart of Europe's natural resource belt. These confluences of resources, transportation, and population led to Europe the birth the industrial revolution and the modern world that came with it.

This isn't an economics class, but in short, after a certain level of development, services are just the easiest and most profitable sectors to develop instead of further industry - this is why the US and Europe are primarily service economies(both have substantial industrial and agricultural sectors, even still), due to their high development. This is also why the developing world is primarily agricultural, with medium development you get proper industry, and with high development you get services. Bangladesh for example, is agricultural and industrial, but has a small service sector, and even the industrial sector is largely low-skill, compared to Europe and the US. 

In conclusion, geography has played a huge role in the development of Europe, and has led to the modern European economy being a trichotomy of agriculture, industry, and services. This has wide-ranging impacts on the culture, politics, and economics of Euroep, and has led substantially to the formation of the modern world as we know it.
