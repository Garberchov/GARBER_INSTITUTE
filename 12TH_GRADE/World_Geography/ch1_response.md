### World Geography Ch. 1 Response

Geography is a fundamentally important part of any understanding of the world and the human civilization we have built on it. In the most basic sense of the science of geography, it is the study of the earth and its features. This understanding, while important, pales into insignificance when the associated fields of geography are combined with this newfound understanding. In the political realm, the geographical reasons behind political boundaries - or not in some cases - are important to understand, and help to explain cultural, political, and economic differences between nations and regions. In the economic realm, geography is important both to critically examine supplies of resources - natural and human - and to understand how natural features assist or hinder the development of these resources.

A combination of these two is directly visible in the history of the South vs. North divide in the United States. The South, with its fertile soil, warm climate, and many navigable rivers, was able to develop a strong agricultural economy - though a lack of easy mineral resources meant that it struggled when trying to develop an industrial base. The North by comparison, with its rocky soil, milder climate, proximity to the ocean, and many natural resources, meant that a densely populated, industrialized economy built on exports was able to develop. This divide in geography and economy had military consequences in the civil war and continues to have political consequences today.

Another example of the far-reaching economic, political, and social effects of geography as mentioned in the first chapter of the textbook is clearly evident in Europe, specifically, Germany. The geographical divisions of Germany led directly to the difficulty in unifying it - which only happened following industrial advances allowing these geographical divides to be bridged. These geographical differences also had a major effect on the cultural development of the German people, and the political development of the German State. One of the major causes of this is the location of Germany as the geographic center of Europe, and for much of its history Germany - and Prussia before it - had enemies on all sides. Thus, the development of a highly ordered, militaristic economic, cultural, and political apparatus was the natural result. This is not something inborn into the "German people", but rather a result of the geography of the region, and the political and economic realities that geography created.

In conclusion, geography is a fundamental determinant of the development of human civilization, and the study of geography is a fundamental part of understanding the world we live in. The effects of geography are subtle but far-reaching, and when the data that geography provides is combined with the goal of far-reaching understanding, the result is greater than the sum of its parts - a truly holistic view of the world we live in.
