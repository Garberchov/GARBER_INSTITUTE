### Chapter 3: Plate Tectonics

#### 3.1. Pangaea
 - In Wegener's model, he proposed that the continents were all joined at one time in Earth's history, making a supercontinent. A supercontinent is a giant landmass made up of many or all continents. He proposed this because if you assume the continents are moving, then continents would be colliding and pulling apart.
 - In 1927, his proposed supercontinent was named Pangaea, which means 'whole earth', and scientists still believe that Pangaea was the most recent supercontinent in the earth's history, existing about 225 million years ago.
 - As more information was discovered about the earth, they realized that the continents are part of large pieces of the earth's crust known as tectonic plates. These tectonic plates are the pieces of the crust that move around on the earth, pushing together, pulling apart and sliding past each other - and those movements are known as plate tectonics.


#### 3.2. Plate Tectonics: A Unified Theory
 - Plate tectonics is the theory that the surface of the earth is broken into larger pieces of crust called plates that ride along on a softer layer of the earth, known as the asthenosphere, which is the upper part of the mantle.
 - The main theory of plate movement states that heat from the core causes convection cells in the mantle that move the plates as they ride on the mantle. The main source of heat that drives this process is thought to be the radioactive decay of uranium and other elements that give up their energy as heat as they break down. All this heat softens the rock enough that it will begin to flow. The plates are moved by the convection cells in the mantle, which are like giant conveyor belts that move the plates around the earth.


#### 3.3. Continental Drift
 - Other clues came from more research. He discovered that in his Pangea model, large geologic features such as mountain ranges on separate continents often lined up closely. Rock strata from Africa and South America also matched when placed together with South America and Africa lining up.
 - Puzzling data of fossils of plants and animals found in climates where they could never have survived was also explained, similar to the glossopteris tropical ferns growing in Antarctica. Coal was found in Antarctica and Britain, areas that could never support coal formation today.
 - Putting all this data together, Wegener concluded that the continents were at one time all together in a giant supercontinent and that somehow they broke apart and migrated to their present location.
 - There was some trouble with this theory, though. He called this theory continental drift and talked to many other scientists and geologists about it. His theory overall was soundly rejected, and often in harsh and scathing language. The big problem was that Wegener had no convincing evidence for how the continents might actually move from place to place. The mechanism for the movement of the continents was missing, and would only later be discovered as plate tectonics.
