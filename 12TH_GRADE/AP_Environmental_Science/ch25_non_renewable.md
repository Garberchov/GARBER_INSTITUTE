#### 25.1: Fossil Fuels

    - You have undoubtedly heard of fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. These are the three main types of fossil fuels. You rely on fossil fuels every day for such tasks as fueling your car and heating your home. And, it's very likely that the electricity in your home comes from a power plant that uses fossil fuels. But, did you know that these fuels were once plant and animal life? That's right; fossil fuels are actually the accumulated remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago. As we mentioned, the story of fossil fuels began millions of years ago, even before the dinosaurs first appeared on Earth. At that time, there were tiny plants and animals living in the oceans of the world. As these plants and animals died, they would sink down and settle on the ocean floor. This organic matter was eventually covered by layers of sand, rock and mud that later turned into sedimentary rock.
    - As these layers of rock grew thicker and thicker, the organic matter ended up being placed under a great amount of pressure. Over the millions of years that passed, this high pressure transformed the partially decomposed plant and animal matter into the major energy source that we know as oil and natural gas.
    - Coal is formed through the same type of process. However, coal originates mainly from dead tree and plant matter. Millions of years ago, leafy plants and trees died and sank into swamps and bogs that covered much of the Earth. This created a soupy plant-filled stew called peat. The peat became buried under layers of sediment, and water was squeezed out. Over the course of millions of years, compounds within the peat were subjected to heat and pressure, transforming them into the carbon-rich substance we know as coal.
    - Fossil fuels are a great source of energy because they originate from living things. We know that plants and trees use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water, using the process called photosynthesis. This is an easy term to recall when you remember that the prefix 'photo' is Greek for light, and the suffix 'synthesis' means to make, so photosynthesis is using the energy of sunlight to make food. This energy from the sun gets stored in the plants and transferred to any animal that eats the plants. Now keep in mind, the dead plant and animal matter that made up these fossil fuels didn't have much time to decay. They sank into the water and were buried with much of their substance intact. This allowed the energy within them to remain as they were transformed.
    - There are many advantages of fossil fuels. Even though they are consumed in mass amounts, they are still abundant and accessible. Fossil fuels provide a large amount of concentrated energy for a relatively low cost. Their abundance allows power plants to be fueled by them, creating a great deal of electricity for the world. Additionally, oil can be transported through the use of pipes, allowing it to be transported relatively easily. Natural gas is a clean fuel and is highly efficient. It is widely used by businesses and residential homes for heating, cooking, making hot water and drying clothes. Additionally, 99% of the natural gas we use comes from North America, helping America be more self-sufficient.
    - As helpful and valuable as fossil fuels are, they are not without flaws. One of the main disadvantages of fossil fuels is the fact that when they are burned, they produce carbon dioxide. The high levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are one of the factors leading to global climate change, which is defined as a long-term change in the Earth's climate.
    - Coal is an especially problematic fuel when it comes to pollution. The burning of coal causes the release of pollutants into the atmosphere that fall back to Earth as precipitation, which is a phenomenon called acid rain. Additionally, the general extraction and transporting of fossil fuels can be harmful. For example, coal mining is very dangerous. Oil must be transported once obtained, and this is often done by ships. If a problem occurs during transport, oil spills can damage fragile marine environments and pollute the ocean.
    - But, one of the most prominent concerns is the fact that all fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources. Being a nonrenewable resource means that once the fuel is burned for energy, it cannot be replaced during our lifetime, due to the fact that they take millions of years to form. For this reason, renewable, alternative energy resources are becoming more common, such as solar and wind power.

#### 25.2: Energy Consumption

    - Energy consumption is the term used to describe the consumption of the sources of energy that generate power. Energy is generated from nonrenewable fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas. It can also be generated from renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, hydroelectric power and biofuels.
    - The world's energy consumption is determined by the energy consumption of individuals. Generally, we see that a person living in a developed country, which has a highly developed economy, will consume more energy than a person living in a developing country that is non-industrialized and poor. If the economy of a developing country improves, the energy consumption for that country rises. This is the case in such developing countries as China.

#### 25.3: Coal mining

    - Coal is comprised mostly of carbon and is found underground. When it's lying in the earth undisturbed, it does not impact the environment. However, when we pull coal out of the ground and burn it to generate electricity, the coal is converted to carbon dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere along with other pollutants.
    - Carbon dioxide is a 'greenhouse gas,' which is a gas in the atmosphere that absorbs infrared radiation and traps heat. Burning coal is one of the main contributors to carbon dioxide buildup. This buildup of carbon dioxide creates an invisible layer in the atmosphere that allows incoming sunlight to pass through, but then traps the heat. This trapped heat causes the surface of the earth and the lower atmosphere to warm up, which is a process known as the 'greenhouse effect.'
    - Coal is an abundant fuel source and could be a source of electricity for many years to come, if we could just find a way to make coal cleaner. Fortunately, there are many teams of scientists hard at work to solve this problem; and thanks to the clean coal technologies that they have developed, we may see a reduction in the environmental effects of coal burning in the future.
    - Now, if you have ever seen a coal burning plant, one of the things that likely caught your attention was the billowing smoke and gases that pour out of the smokestacks. This is called 'flue gas.' This flue gas can contain many impurities, such as sulfur and nitrogen, and these impurities combine with water vapor and fall to the earth as acid rain.
    - Coal washing is a type of coal preparation that removes impurities. The process involves crushing the coal into small chunks and washing it. During the washing process, the coal floats to the surface while the sulfur and other impurities sink.
    - Another way to make coal burning cleaner is to use flue gas desulfurization systems, which are also known as 'scrubbers.' These systems remove sulfur dioxide from the flue gas. This is an easy term to recall if you remember that the prefix 'de' means to remove, and the term 'sulfur' is found in the word. Therefore, flue gas desulfurization systems literally remove sulfur dioxide from the flue gas. During this process, the flue gas is sprayed with limestone and water. The limestone and sulfur combine with each other to form a wet paste that looks somewhat like the toothpaste you use to scrub your teeth clean in the morning. Although, I wouldn't recommend using this type of paste to freshen your breath.
    - Nitrogen is a normal part of the air we breathe, and we tolerate nitrogen just fine. However, when air is heated, as it is when coal is burned, the nitrogen atoms break apart and join with oxygen to form 'nitrogen oxide,' or 'NOx,' which is the abbreviation and rhymes with socks. Nitrogen oxide is a pollutant that causes smog and acid rain. Low-NOx burners reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by restricting oxygen and manipulating the combustion process when coal is burned.
    - Gasification is another method that scientists have found to make coal cleaner, and as its name suggests, it involves the conversion of coal into gas. With gasification, coal is subjected to steam and hot pressured air to break the carbon molecules apart. This results in a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which can be used to spin a gas turbine to generate electricity. Gasification can remove impurities from coal and is a great way to clean pollution out of coal.
    - This process is called carbon capture and storage, or CCS. CCS is defined as the process of capturing carbon dioxide and transporting it to permanent underground storage. When carbon capture and storage is utilized at a coal burning plant, much of the carbon dioxide generated during the burning of coal is transported by pipeline or other mode to sites where it can be stored deep underground in areas, such as depleted oil or gas fields, preventing it from being released into the atmosphere.
    - This is what the (old) study.com lessons says: clean coal is a myth. The process of mining coal is dirty and dangerous, and the burning of coal is a major contributor to global warming. The only way to make coal clean is to leave it in the ground.

#### 25.4: Oil & Natural Gas Reserves

    - Oil and natural gas are trapped within porous rocks deep under the earth's crust. Early Native Americans were the first to discover oil seeping out of the earth and collecting on the surface of lakes and ponds. They would skim the water with blankets to gather oil to use for burning. But in 1859, a man named Edwin Drake used a drilling method to tap into the oil deposits under his property, moving us toward the Age of Oil. In this lesson, we will learn more about how oil and natural gas is extracted from the earth, and discuss how much remains to be drilled.
    - Developed countries, like the United States, run on oil. According to the Energy Information Administration, gasoline for cars, SUVs and light trucks accounts for roughly 45% of the oil we use. Yet oil does more than just fuel our transportation methods. Many items we use every day contain oil, and some of them would surprise you! Now, you may already know that oil is used to make plastic products, and our modern-day farms could not run without massive inputs of oil for fertilizer and pesticide manufacture. More than this, petroleum is used to make a million products. Nylon, crayons, lipstick, asphalt - all petroleum products.
    - Petroleum geologists are geologists who specialize in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. It is the petroleum geologist's job to evaluate areas where oil and natural gas might be found. If they find an oil deposit that can be economically recovered using existing technologies, it is said to be a proved reserve, or a 'proven reserve.' While there is some debate, it is estimated that at present, proved reserves of oil could meet demand for the next few decades, if the rate of consumption stays the same.
    - There is also thought to be more oil and natural gas reserves that have yet to be discovered. However, these reserves may be in more difficult areas to access and therefore harder to extract. To tackle the problem of hard-to-extract oil and natural gas deposits, petroleum geologists are continually developing new technologies to squeeze more fuel from existing reserves and reach previously inaccessible fields.
    - Oil and natural gas is extracted from rock deep within the earth using a drilling method. Traditionally, this involves an oil rig, which is a structure with equipment used for drilling oil and gas. If the oil is found at sea, as opposed to under land, an 'offshore oil rig' is used in a similar fashion. With many of the easily accessible oil reserves already depleted, oil extraction has become more creative, thanks to new advances in extraction technologies. These advances in technology have increased the ability of oil companies to extract oil and natural gas from previously inaccessible locations, and also squeeze more oil out of existing reserves. Let's take a look at some of the technological advancements.

#### 25.5: Fracking

    - Shale gas is a natural gas produced from shale. There are high hopes for shale gas, and some scientists expect it to greatly increase the world's supply of natural gas. However, shale gas is not found in big bubbles under the earth that can be easily tapped into and extracted.
    - Instead, gas is dispersed throughout the shale rock formation. Because it is found within the rock, a special extraction method must be used, known as hydraulic fracturing. You can recall this term by remembering that the word 'hydraulic' refers to the use of water or other fluid under pressure, and 'fracturing' refers to breaking apart. So we see that hydraulic fracturing is the process of breaking apart rock formations by injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals. This process is sometimes referred to as 'hydrofracking,' or simply 'fracking,' and using it allows the shale gas to be released, so it can be collected and brought to the surface.
    - It is more expensive than just drilling a well, but at sufficient scale or for geostrategic protection, it can be worth it.

#### 25.7: Nuclear Power

    - The risks outlined in the lesson are simply incorrect.
