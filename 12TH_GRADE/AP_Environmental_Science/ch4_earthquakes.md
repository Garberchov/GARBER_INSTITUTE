#### 4.1: What is an Earthquake?
 - Earthquakes are the result of stress along plate boundarie, and when they press into each other hard enough to break, the energy is released as an earthquake. Compressional stress occurs when rocks are pushed together - they're pressed into one another. Tensional stress occurs when rocks are pulled apart - they're being stretched farther than they would be otherwise. Shear stress is when rocks slide past each other in opposite directions. All of these stresses can cause earthquakes.

#### 4.2. Causes of Earthquakes
 - The place where the bumping and sliding occurs along the plate boundaries is called a fault. Plate boundaries can have many faults, and most of the world's earthquakes occur along plate boundaries for this reason. The 'Ring of Fire' is an area where most of the world's earthquakes occur because it lines up with many of the plate boundaries. The San Andreas Fault in California is one of the most famous because it runs much of the length of the state and is very active. California's many earthquakes are a result of this dynamic plate boundary.
 - There are two different types of seismic waves: body waves and surface waves. Body waves are seismic waves that travel through the ground under Earth's surface and surface waves are seismic waves that travel through Earth's surface.
