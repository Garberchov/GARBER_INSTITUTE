### Chapter 22: Mining and Fishing

#### 22.1 Overfishing

    - Overfishing is the act of catching fish faster than they can reproduce. This can lead to the extinction of certain species of fish, and the collapse of entire ecosystems due to the knock-on effects of removing a species from the food chain.
    - One reason overfishing occurs is because of those large commercial fishing vessels. They're so big and so numerous that we could essentially fish four Earth-sized planets with all of those ships! Clearly, this is more than necessary, and if all of them are out there trying to catch fish, then this becomes a problem.
    - The gear these vessels use to catch fish also contributes to overfishing. Much of the gear that is used catches everything it comes across instead of being more selective. A large contributor to overfishing comes in the form of bycatch, which is marine life that is unintentionally caught in the fishing gear. Non-target fish species, sea turtles, marine mammals, and even birds are all caught as bycatch in various types of fishing gear.
    - We can't put all the blame on fishing vessels though, since they are only trying to meet a growing demand for seafood. Since 1973, global fish consumption has doubled, and those who fish for a living are only trying to keep up with an ever-increasing human population that depends on seafood as a healthy protein source.
    - It's estimated that at least 80% of the world's monitored fisheries are either fully or overexploited. This means that the fishery is being fished above a sustainable level. And, as you can probably imagine, this has some serious implications for both ocean ecosystems as well as humans.
    - Overfishing can also cause problems because some fishing techniques are physically destructive. For example, bottom trawls are nets pulled along the seafloor behind a boat, and they are like giant bulldozers dragging across the bottom. They pick up and knock over just about everything in their path and are considered one of the most destructive types of fishing gear. Dynamite fishing is another destructive technique and is just what it sounds like - the use of explosives to blast fish from the water. As you can imagine, the explosion not only destroys the physical environment, but also kills any other organisms that happen to be in the water where the explosion occurred.
    - While overfishing is indeed a very serious problem, the good news is that there are practical ways that we can help turn this situation around. Management of fisheries is a critical factor in preventing the further decline of many of the world's fisheries. This involves enforcing regulations, such as catch limits, gear modifications, and bycatch reduction. These regulations help ensure that only sustainable numbers of fish are caught, allowing populations to recover in spite of fishing pressure.
    - Setting aside protected marine habitat is another good way to help fisheries recover from fishing efforts. Many of these areas serve as critical spawning and reproductive grounds where fish populations can rebuild without the threat of harvest.
    - A newer approach to curb overfishing involves catch shares, which divides a total catch limit among all participating fishers. This works much like carbon credits for businesses, as each person or group is allocated a certain portion of the total catch, and they can fish for it whenever they like. This is a promising method because instead of limiting the fishing season to the same time of year for everyone, which leads to a 'fishing derby' where everyone races out to catch as many fish as they can in that short period, it extends the season and spreads out the time that people can fish. This in turn reduces the pressure on the fishery, creating a more sustainable outcome. This method is also beneficial because it allows fishers to make a living all year long, instead of just during a short, limited season. This is dependent on an accurate, enforceable, and monitored system - Hayek, and I, are skeptical of the government's ability to do this effectively. In addition, this can raise the price of fish for consumers, which is problematic because low-cost(relatively) protein is an important part of our growing population's diet.

#### 22.2 Aquaculture

    - Have you ever eaten fish or shellfish? If so, do you have any idea where it came from? Most of us assume our seafood comes from the ocean, but in fact, one-third of all seafood consumed worldwide does not come from natural ecosystems. Aquaculture is the practice of growing aquatic species in pens or nets. Most aquaculture includes the use of ponds, holding tanks, or nets that float in open water. Species are grown in these controlled environments and harvested for sale.
    - Although aquaculture is also known as fish farming, this technique is actually used to grow over 220 different species of freshwater and marine organisms. While around half of aquaculture facilities are dedicated to growing fish, others grow and harvest mollusks, such as clams and mussels, crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimp, and aquatic plants. Aquaculture was established mainly to help reduce the pressure on natural fish populations.
    - Although there are many advantages to aquaculture, it has become evident over time that aquaculture causes harm to the environment in a variety of ways. One large problem with aquaculture is that organisms are grown in large numbers in small areas. This concentrated setting can cause some major problems that influence the environment. First, this setting results in a large amount of uneaten food and bodily waste being released into the environment. This unnatural increase in nutrients often results in the creation of algal blooms, which can negatively impact native species by reducing the amount of oxygen available in the water.
    - The concentrated setting of aquaculture also increases the risk of diseases. In many cases, organisms raised in aquaculture settings are given antibiotics to combat these diseases. As a result of aquaculture, there is increased risk of spreading diseases to natural populations and increased risk of pollution from medications used to combat diseases.
    - Although aquaculture was originally created to help reduce stress on natural fish populations, in some cases it has increased the pressure on natural fish populations. Some farmed species of fish are fed a fish meal made from wild-caught fish, such as herring and anchovies. This requires the harvesting of large quantities of herring and anchovies in order to feed the farmed fish, which puts a great deal of pressure on these natural fish populations.
    - Aquaculture also influences the environment around it by increasing the risk of invasive species. Many aquatic organisms are farmed in non-native areas. If they escape into the ecosystem, they would be considered an invasive species. They could spread disease to native species and even outcompete native species for food and habitat.
    - In summary, I am still waiting on my food replicator to be delivered. Until then, we must continue to rely on aquaculture and fishing to provide us with the seafood we love.

#### 22.3 Fishing Laws

    - One of the most important international laws for aquatic systems is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS. This convention sets a comprehensive legal framework to regulate the space, uses, and resources of the world's oceans, which includes fisheries, marine mammals, and even aquatic plants.
    - You can think of CITES, The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, as the international version of this because its aim is to ensure that international trade does not threaten the survival of animals and plants in the wild.
    - CITES was signed into law in 1973 and is very important for fisheries because many fish and other marine species migrate incredible distances and cross national boundaries. These species are often traded internationally, meaning that in order to conserve them, international cooperation among multiple nations is required. CITES sets the stage for regulation of this international trade, helping to ensure their survival. Another important law of 1973 is MARPOL, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships. The acronym comes from the combination of the two words 'Marine Pollution' and is designed to minimize ocean pollution from ships, such as oil and exhaust, dumping, and any other intentional or accidental source of ocean pollution.
    - The '70s were a golden decade for environmental regulation, both internationally and in the United States. The Marine Mammal Protection Act, or MMPA, was enacted in 1972 to protect marine mammals from human activities. This law banned any capture, killing, hunting, or harming of marine mammals, as well as the importation of any marine mammals or their products.
    - Commercial fishing gear is a major player in the death and injury of marine mammals. Because of this, the MMPA requires commercial fisheries to take steps to reduce their effects on marine mammal species to what are called 'insignificant levels.' Heard of dolphin-safe tuna? That's just one way this law has influenced fisheries to be more mindful and sustainable.
    - 1972 also saw the enactment of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, or NMSA. This law designates critical marine environments as sanctuaries, based on their environmental, cultural, or historical significance. Thirteen sanctuaries currently exist in the National Marine Sanctuary System, and these sanctuaries are also part of the over 1,700 U.S. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). MPAs are protected for conservation purposes and include not only sanctuaries, but also places like National Estuarine Research Reserves, national wildlife refuges, and national parks.
    - 1976 saw the enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, also known as The Magnuson-Stevens Act. This act was designed to provide conservation and management of U.S. fish populations. It established eight regional fisheries management councils across the country, each of which develops management plans for its fisheries and establishes guidelines, such as catch quotas, gear restrictions, and bycatch limits.

#### 22.4 Earth's resources

    - Once again, as reiterated from previous chapters, the resources available to human are not systemically limited to those *on* Earth. The rest of the universe awaits, think in an abundance mindset, not a scarcity mindset.
    - Let's start with minerals and look at them in more depth. Minerals are naturally occurring inorganic solids that have a crystalline structure and definite chemical composition. Minerals are referred to as naturally occurring because they are formed though natural geological processes. Minerals are non-living and have a crystalline structure, meaning the atoms that make up the mineral are arranged in an orderly, three-dimensional pattern that repeats itself. Minerals are said to have a definite composition because all minerals are made up of specific proportions of certain elements.
    - Now that we know what minerals are, we can discuss rocks. Rocks are defined as naturally formed aggregates of minerals or mineral-like substances. Rocks can be made up of one type of mineral, several minerals, or no minerals at all. Limestone is a rock that is comprised of the mineral calcite. Many crystals of calcite are cemented together to form the limestone. Granite is a rock that is comprised of several different minerals, including quartz, biotite, potassium feldspar, and plagioclase feldspar. Coal is an example of a rock that isn't comprised of any minerals, but instead is made of decomposed organic matter.
    - Soil is another of Earth's materials. Soil is a mixture of decomposed organic matter and broken down rocks and minerals. The decomposed organic matter is mainly dead plant material. The broken down rocks and minerals are formed when larger rocks and minerals are made into smaller pieces due to erosion or weathering. On average, soil is made up of 45% rock and mineral pieces, 5% decomposed organic matter, and 50% pore space. The rock and mineral pieces are what plants attach their roots to in order to anchor themselves in place. The decomposed organic matter is responsible for producing nutrients for plants and increasing water retention. The pore spaces in soil are very important because they allow water and air to circulate through the soil. The water and air transport nutrients and carbon dioxide, which are essential for the growth of plants.

#### 22.5. Global Mineral Reserves

    -  Our global mineral reserves are directly tied to local, national, and global economies. It's difficult to fully grasp just how many minerals you utilize in just one day. For example, when you drive your car, you might think of the gasoline you use to power it, but the vehicle itself is made of more than a ton of iron and steel, 240 pounds of aluminum, 50 pounds of carbon, 42 pounds of copper, and upwards of 30 other minerals, such as zinc, gold, and platinum.
    - We certainly can't talk about mineral reserves without discussing the environment. Mining itself is very physically destructive to the earth, and it also creates a lot of pollution and waste. Extracting mineral reserves produces air pollution, affects water quality through chemical runoff, contributes to acid rain, and mines themselves can leak heavy metals that are toxic to us and other organisms.
    - As we work our way through our global mineral reserves, it takes a greater amount of energy to extract the minerals. Water is also used in a variety of ways in mining operations, often by diverting surface water and pumping groundwater. This can reduce water quality and quantity, which affects not only local aquatic ecosystems, but also those downstream as well.
    - Conservation efforts have become a greater part of legislation around mining, something I strongly support, but the tailings from mining operations are still a major issue. Tailings are the waste material that is left over after the valuable minerals have been extracted from the ore. These tailings are often stored in large piles or ponds, and they can contain heavy metals and other toxic substances that can leach into the environment. This is a major issue because these substances can contaminate water supplies and harm aquatic ecosystems. There are ways to mitigate this, but the application of these solutions is inconsistent worldwide.

#### 22.6. Mining Laws

    - Because of this, the International Labour Organization (ILO), which is an agency under the UN concerned with international labor issues that promotes the rights of workers, determined a convention was needed to protect the health and safety of mine workers. The convention that was eventually adopted for this purpose was the Safety and Health in Mines Convention of 1995.
    - You may be thinking that 1995 is fairly recent for such regulations to be outlined for miners. Unfortunately, there were previous conventions that did address miner health and safety issues but did not outline enough laws that specifically dealt with these topics. And that's where the 1995 convention comes in - it directly tackled the issues that miners face, providing much more legal protection for their health and safety.
    - As of 2014, 29 different countries have ratified this convention, which means that they agree to follow the rules and regulations it outlines. The U.S. is one of these countries, and we signed the convention in 2001, making us the 16th country to do so. However, there was considerable overlap with the many federal laws that the U.S. already implements for mine safety. In fact, there was so much overlap that the convention did not really contribute any notable changes to our mining practices. Instead, it served as a political strategy, allowing us to put pressure on other nations by holding them accountable for their own mine workers' health and safety.
    - In the U.S., mine safety is regulated by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, which is an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor. This agency is responsible for enforcing the regulations of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Often just called the Mine Act, this law sets safety and health standards for miners and requires annual inspections of all U.S. mines by MSHA. It's an amended version of the Coal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, usually just called the Coal Act, which was the most comprehensive and strict federal legislation for mining at that time.
    - The Mine Act made some significant improvements to the Coal Act. Not only did it consolidate federal regulations for the health and safety of all mining operations (coal and non-coal), but it also provided greater protection for miners, as well as expanded their rights.
    - In 2006 came even stronger federal legislation, in the form of the MINER Act, or the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act. Previously, an emergency response plan was developed after an accident occurred, which wasted both time and resources. One major change seen in the MINER Act was the requirement that mine-specific emergency response plans be developed ahead of time and are continuously updated as appropriate. The MINER Act also required emergency responders to be better trained and be more readily available to respond to mine accidents.
    - One way to mitigate issues in mining is through reclamation, or restoring an area that has been disturbed by surface or underground mining. The word means just what it sounds like - reclaiming the land for future use. There are a number of ways to reclaim a mine site, but no matter how you do it, if it's a surface mine, you're bound by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. This federal law regulates environmental effects from coal mining by setting guidelines for coal mines. It also established a trust fund to provide financial support for reclamation activities.
