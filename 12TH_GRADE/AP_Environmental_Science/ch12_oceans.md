#### 12.1 Active and Passive Continental Margins
 - To understand active and passive continental margins, we must first understand the difference between continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust is the crust that makes up the continents, and the oceanoic crust is the crust that "supports" the ocean floor.
 - The continental crust is less dense than the material that makes up the underlying mantle, so it tends to float on top of the mantle and move around. Of course, even though we live on the continental crust, we do not feel this movement because it's very slow, in the range of about 1-10 centimeters during the course of a year.
 - The continental crust is also less dense than the oceanic crust, so the oceanic crust does not move as much. But, because the continental crust is moving, it can knock into the oceanic crust at a place called the continental margin. We can define the continental margin as the zone that separates the continental crust from the oceanic crust.
 - In effect, anywhere that you find a continent meeting an ocean, you will find a continental margin. Back to the two types, active and passive. An active continental margin has plate tectonic activity, and a passive continental margin does not. 
 - In effect, the West vs East coasts of the United States exemplify the difference between active and passive continental margins. There are no earthquakes or volcanoes on the East coast, but there are on the West coast. 

#### 12.2 Ocean Basin
 - About 70% of the planet's surface is made up of ocean basins, which are the regions that are below sea level. These areas hold the majority of the planet's water.
 - Ocean basins can be either active, with a lot of new structures being created and shaped, or they can be inactive, where their surface is slow to change and does little more than collect sediment. The Gulf of Mexico is an example of an inactive ocean basin where the main change that happens is the slow depositing of sand and sediment(and oil, for that matter).
 - Active ocean basins undergo change mainly due to plate tectonics, which is the movement of the Earth's crust.
 - Plates can spread apart by moving away from each other. This creates gaps where hot molten rock, called magma, from the earth's mantle can rise up. When the magma seeps through the gaps, it solidifies as it cools, creating a new layer of ocean crust. This creates structures, such as oceanic ridges, which are continuous mountain chains located under the surface of the sea.
 - An abyssal hill is another raised feature found within ocean basins. It is defined as a small elevated landform that rises from the great depths of the ocean. It might help you to recall this term by remembering that an 'abyss' is something that is very deep. So an abyssal hill is a hill found on the deep ocean floor.
 - A seamount is a large submerged volcanic mountain rising from the ocean floor. Seamounts can be very large, reaching heights of up to 10,000 feet, yet they remain submerged under the surface of the water.
 - A guyot is similar to a seamount, but it is a submerged volcanic mountain with a flat top. Guyots receive their flat top after years of erosion caused by waves and other erosive processes.
 -We have looked at some ocean basin features that rise up from the ocean floor, but we also see depressions in the ocean floor, such as oceanic trenches. These trenches extend down below the normal level of the ocean floor and are the deepest parts of the ocean. The deepest trench is the Mariana Trench, which is located in the Pacific Ocean and is over 36,000 feet deep(which isn't even tall enough to reach the Karman line, if you think about it).
