#### 12.1 Active and Passive Continental Margins
 - To understand active and passive continental margins, we must first understand the difference between continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust is the crust that makes up the continents, and the oceanoic crust is the crust that "supports" the ocean floor.
 - The continental crust is less dense than the material that makes up the underlying mantle, so it tends to float on top of the mantle and move around. Of course, even though we live on the continental crust, we do not feel this movement because it's very slow, in the range of about 1-10 centimeters during the course of a year.
 - The continental crust is also less dense than the oceanic crust, so the oceanic crust does not move as much. But, because the continental crust is moving, it can knock into the oceanic crust at a place called the continental margin. We can define the continental margin as the zone that separates the continental crust from the oceanic crust.
 - In effect, anywhere that you find a continent meeting an ocean, you will find a continental margin. Back to the two types, active and passive. An active continental margin has plate tectonic activity, and a passive continental margin does not. 
 - In effect, the West vs East coasts of the United States exemplify the difference between active and passive continental margins. There are no earthquakes or volcanoes on the East coast, but there are on the West coast. 

#### 12.2 Ocean Basin
 - About 70% of the planet's surface is made up of ocean basins, which are the regions that are below sea level. These areas hold the majority of the planet's water.
 - Ocean basins can be either active, with a lot of new structures being created and shaped, or they can be inactive, where their surface is slow to change and does little more than collect sediment. The Gulf of Mexico is an example of an inactive ocean basin where the main change that happens is the slow depositing of sand and sediment(and oil, for that matter).
 - Active ocean basins undergo change mainly due to plate tectonics, which is the movement of the Earth's crust.
 - Plates can spread apart by moving away from each other. This creates gaps where hot molten rock, called magma, from the earth's mantle can rise up. When the magma seeps through the gaps, it solidifies as it cools, creating a new layer of ocean crust. This creates structures, such as oceanic ridges, which are continuous mountain chains located under the surface of the sea.
 - An abyssal hill is another raised feature found within ocean basins. It is defined as a small elevated landform that rises from the great depths of the ocean. It might help you to recall this term by remembering that an 'abyss' is something that is very deep. So an abyssal hill is a hill found on the deep ocean floor.
 - A seamount is a large submerged volcanic mountain rising from the ocean floor. Seamounts can be very large, reaching heights of up to 10,000 feet, yet they remain submerged under the surface of the water.
 - A guyot is similar to a seamount, but it is a submerged volcanic mountain with a flat top. Guyots receive their flat top after years of erosion caused by waves and other erosive processes.
 -We have looked at some ocean basin features that rise up from the ocean floor, but we also see depressions in the ocean floor, such as oceanic trenches. These trenches extend down below the normal level of the ocean floor and are the deepest parts of the ocean. The deepest trench is the Mariana Trench, which is located in the Pacific Ocean and is over 36,000 feet deep(which isn't even tall enough to reach the Karman line, if you think about it).

#### 12.3. Oceanic Ridge System
 - If you were to drain all of that water, it would reveal an ocean floor that is far from smooth. In fact, you would see a continuous mountain chain located under the surface of the sea called the oceanic ridge system. 
 - When you stand on the coast and look out over the ocean, you can't see the ocean floor, but that doesn't mean there's nothing happening down there. In fact, ocean basins are constantly being shaped due to tectonic activity. Tectonic activity is defined as the deformation of the earth's crust due to the movement of tectonic plates. Tectonic activity is the process that leads to the building of oceanic ridges, so it will be beneficial for us to take a closer look at this process.
 -  The lithosphere extends approximately 60 miles below the earth's surface and is fractured into sections. These plate-like sections of lithosphere are called tectonic plates or lithospheric plates. Below the lithosphere, there is a zone of mantle that consists of semisolid rock that is very hot and deformable, known as the asthenosphere. Because this layer is hot and deformable, the plates of the lithosphere are able to slide over the top of it, somewhat like pucks slide over the top of an air hockey table. If the plates move away from each other, a gap is created. Hot molten rock, called magma, from the asthenosphere can push up through this gap, and this is the beginning of the formation of an oceanic ridge. As the magma seeps through the gap, it solidifies as it cools, creating a new layer of ocean crust. This process is called seafloor spreading. The magma that seeps through the gap is called lava once it reaches the surface of the ocean. As the lava cools, it forms a new layer of ocean crust. This process of seafloor spreading is what leads to the formation of oceanic ridges.
 - The oceanic ridges of the world are connected and combine to form the oceanic ridge system, making it the longest mountain range in the world, with a total length of approximately 50,000 miles. The continuous oceanic ridge system is distributed around the globe and parts of it can be found in every ocean. The ridge system travels down the center of the Atlantic Ocean, but in the other major oceans, it tends to meander on a course that is at times off-center and somewhat near land masses.

#### 12.4. Properties of Ocean Water
 - Most of the salt in the oceans originated from land. Rain, as well as moving water in rivers and streams, washes over rocks containing the mineral sodium chloride, which you know as common table salt. The salt is then carried into the oceans. Salt can also find its way into oceans through underwater volcanoes that stir up salt and other minerals from deep layers of the earth.
 - The salt in oceans becomes more concentrated over time as water from the surface of the ocean evaporates, leaving the salt behind. Salt is the main chemical ingredient in ocean water, but it also contains other chemicals, such as magnesium, sulfate, calcium and potassium. Many scientists believe that life began in the oceans, so it's not surprising that chemicals found in seawater are important chemicals needed to sustain life.
 - In addition, Oceans act as carbon sinks, which means that they are natural environments that absorb and store carbon dioxide. So oceans remove carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere, making them important players in the study of global climate changes.
 - There is more gold in the oceans than humanity has mined in our history, but it is so diluted that it is not economical to mine it.
 - Oceans have a wide range of temperatures. The temperature is highest at the equator and grows increasingly colder as the water approach the poles. Compared to air, ocean water has a very high heat capacity. This means that there is more energy required to change the temperature of water. In other words, it takes a long time for the sun's energy to heat the ocean waters. And once the ocean is heated up, it takes a long time for the water to fully release that heat.
 - The freezing point for ocean water is 28 F, which is lower than the freezing point of freshwater. This is because of the salt in the water. The salt lowers the freezing point of water, which is why we put salt on icy roads in the winter. The salt lowers the freezing point of the water on the road, which helps to melt the ice.

#### 12.5. Marine Organisms 
 - Oceans are home to all sizes of creatures, from microscopic organisms to the world's largest animals. Let's start our discussion with some of the tiniest marine organisms there are, called plankton. Not the kind from SpongeBob though, but tiny/microscopic organisms that float in collective groups nearish to the surface of the water.
 - Plankton have no propulsion of their own, so they are at the total mercy of ocena currents. Some Plankton even photosynthesize, which means that they use the sun's energy to make their own food. Plankton are the base of the ocean food chain, so they are very important to the survival of many other marine organisms.
 - Seaweed is also a type of marine plant - it is an algae that grows with a very wide flat leaf such that it can absorb tons of sunlight. 
 - Many of the more unusual creatures of the sea are classified as invertebrates. The prefix 'in' means 'lacking,' and the suffix 'vertebrate' refers to having 'a backbone.' So, invertebrates, by definition, are 'lacking a backbone.'(otherwise known as Ron Desantis) Invertebrates are abundant in the ocean waters, and this might be because the ocean waters buoy them, making a backbone an unneeded feature.
 - Invertebrates also "glide" through the water in comparison to more complex vertebrates which use more body parts(due to having a fixed backbone) to move through the water. These include jellyfish, squids, octopus, sea anemones, and starfish.
 - Even though starfish have the word 'fish' in their name, they are not actually fish, because fish have backbones, making them vertebrates. Still, not the point! Even though fish are varied, they share many features that allow them to live under water. For example, they have fins that they use for propulsion, gills to extract oxygen from the water and protective scales covering their bodies. Many fish also have swim bladders, which are like internal air balloons that they can use to control buoyancy as they move to different depths within the water.
 - Ocean waters can get mighty cold, so it's surprising to learn about just how many warm-blooded mammals make their homes in the oceans. Marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, manatees, sea otters, seals and walruses share many characteristics with land-dwelling mammals, including you and me. For instance, all mammals, whether they live on land or under the water, give birth to live young and feed their young with milk. But, marine mammals have some adaptations that allow them to live in the harsh ocean environment. These adaptations include fur and a high fat content for warmth. They also have skin that is impervious to the salty seawater. The most extreme mammal in the ocean are probably whales, which are both gigantic and warm-blooded despite the depths they can reach.
 - Discussing this would be incomplete without mentioning reptiles and sea birds - neither of which actually live in the ocean, but are dependent on water for food. Seabirds have huge evolutionary adjustments to catch fish, and reptiles like sea turtles, crocodiles, and others feed in marine environments and lay their eggs there.
