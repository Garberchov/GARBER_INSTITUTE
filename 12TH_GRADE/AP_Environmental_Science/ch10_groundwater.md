### Chapter 10: Groundwater

## 10.1: Groundwater System 
 - Groundwater is an important component of the water cycle, which is the natural cycling of water through phases and locations on Earth. The water that soaks into the ground sometimes comes back out above ground in other locations, feeding the world's rivers, lakes, streams, and oceans.
 - Much of the world's groundwater is stored in aquifers, which are underground water reservoirs, usually made of rock like limestone. The limestone acts like a giant rock sponge, soaking up the water and holding it for thousands of years. One of the world's largest aquifers is the Ogallala Aquifer in the Great Plains of the U.S. This aquifer is one large connected system, stretching from South Dakota to Texas and from Colorado to Arkansas! Because aquifers hold so much water, they take a very long time to fill, sometimes thousands or even millions of years.
 - Groundwater also helps sedimentary rock form, acting as an adhesive that holds the rock together. 
 - Geysers are the result of groundwater; if the water underground is above a near-surface magma source, this magma underneath heats the water. As the water heats, the pressure builds up, sometimes escaping at the surface. When this happens, the result is the same as heating a kettle of water on the stove. Steam escapes through a small opening in the surface and we get a geyser, like Old Faithful.
 - Sinkholes are funnel-shaped cavities in the ground. They are literally holes that occur from the ground sinking. Groundwater holds the land underground in place, and when it's removed, that ground just sinks downward to fill the empty space. Sinkholes can be small, or they can be very large like Lake Eola in downtown Orlando. Once a sinkhole, Lake Eola has since been turned into a park in the middle of the city, and this open-air ground hole is an incredible 23 acres in size!

## 10.2: Groundwater Movement
 - One factor that influences how groundwater moves is the porosity of a soil. This is the amount of water the soil can hold.
 - The size and shape of the soil particles determine porosity in this same way. When particles are about the same size and shape, there tend to be larger open spaces since the particles don't fit together very well. Clay and sand are both very porous materials for this reason. On the other hand, sediment like limestone is less porous because the particles fit together like puzzle pieces, closing up those pores. 
 - Porosity tells us how much water the soil can take in, but not how fast it does so. We call the rate of water infiltration into the ground permeability. In the same way as a sponge absorbs water really well, and a cement block doesn't, it is due to permeability.
 - Soil is the same way - some sediments easily absorb water, while others do not. Remember how clay was very porous? Turns out that even though it can hold a lot of water, it's not very permeable, so it takes a long time to absorb it. Sand, on the other hand, is both porous and permeable. It can hold a lot of water and is happy to take it in. Limestone is a tricky one, though, because it is very permeable, but not very porous. So, it will absorb water very well, but its capacity is not as large as something like clay or sand, until it starts absorbing water. Once it does, it can hold a lot of water, but it takes a while to get there.

## 10.3. Springs
 - I'll bet that if you look at a bottle of water, it claims to be 'natural spring' water. While this may or may not be true, what exactly do they mean by 'spring'? A spring is a place where water naturally flows out of the ground. This comes from the German word 'springer,' which means 'to leap from the ground.'
 - There are two types of acquifers: confined and unconfined. Confined aquifers are those that are surrounded by impermeable rock or clay. This means that the water in the aquifer is under pressure, and when it finds a weak spot in the rock, it can burst out of the ground, forming a spring. Springs let large amounts of water flow out of the ground, and they are a great source of fresh water for people and animals(cities in places without rivers or lakes often rely on springs for their water).
 - There are multiple types of springs:
    - Gravity Spring: The water gets pulled down due to gravity, it can't go down any further at some point(hard rock, etc), so it pushes back up.
    - Artesian Spring: When confined aquifers are under pressure, they look for tiny gaps in the rock to escape. Eventually, these gaps get bigger and bigger, and the water can flow out of the ground. This is an artesian spring.
    - Seepage Spring: Seepage springs slowly let water out through loose soil or rock and are often found in land depressions or low in valleys.
    - Tubular Spring: These springs occur in underground cave systems, which resemble underground highways. These tubes, or channels, are made of limestone, and as water moves through this type of rock, it dissolves some of it away. These can be gigantic, more like lunar magma tubes than caves.
    - Fissure Springs:Fissures are just large cracks, so you can probably figure out that fissure springs occur along large cracks in the ground, like fault lines. Fissure springs are often used as a source of drinking water.

## 10.4 Wells
 - Access to the water table has always provided an important source of drinking water, most often through wells. A well is a human-made hole in the ground specifically used for accessing groundwater. Wells come in different shapes and sizes, but their use is generally the same. In fact, for many people in both developed and developing countries, well water is still the main supply of water for home uses, irrigation and drinking water. Groundwater is even more important in areas that lack surface water, such as deserts.
 - There are three main ways that wells are created. Originally, all wells were dug wells. These are wells that are created by digging it out by hand. Wells are rarely made this way anymore, because let's face it, who wants to spend all day digging a hole in the ground with a shovel? Dug wells are dug down below the water table and lined with a material, like stone or brick. This helps support the well and keep it from collapsing.
 - The other types are driven wells, which are created by driving a pipe into the ground. This is done by hand or with a machine. The pipe is then lined with a screen to keep out sediment and debris. These are comparatively efficient and inexpensive to create, but they are not very deep, so they are not used in areas where the water table is far below the surface. The other type is drilled, which is the most common today - in effect, you get a massive drill bit and drill down into the ground. This is very expensive, but it allows you to get to the water table, even if it is very deep. Drilled wells are lined with a pipe and a screen, just like driven wells.

#### 10.5. Groundwater Pollution
 - Groundwater is one of our most important natural resources. It provides us with much of the water that we use for drinking water, household uses, crop irrigation, and many other things. In fact, over 1/3 of Earth's population relies on groundwater for its needs, including 99% of the rural population in the U.S.
 - But, just because it's underground doesn't mean that groundwater is safe from many of the same environmental issues that surface water faces. In fact, being underground makes it more vulnerable to environmental issues because we can't easily access it for testing, regulating, and cleaning. Groundwater also moves around a lot, not only underground, but also as a source of discharge into Earth's streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans.
 - Pesticides, chemicals, fertilizers, salt from roadways, and just about anything can pollute groundwater - and it does. In fact, groundwater is incredibly easy to pollute and extremely difficult to clean in any meaningful way. This is because groundwater moves around a lot, and it is very difficult to track where it goes. In addition, when you overdraw it - that is, take out more water than is being replaced - you can cause the water table to drop, which can cause the ground to sink, or even collapse. This is called subsidence, and it can cause a lot of damage to buildings and other structures.

#### 10.6. Caverns and Sinkholes
 - Sinkholes are funnel-shaped holes in the ground, and caverns are large caves underground.
 - When too much groundwater is removed in a short period of time, the ground can collapse, literally filling in the empty space with the ground above it. This causes sinkholes, which can be huge or small, depending on the total amount of ground that collapses. 
 - Caverns are formed in a similar way, just underground. When groundwater dissolves sediment, it simply leaves a big whole and nothing fills it in. Caverns can also have stalactites and stalagmites, which are formed when water drips from the ceiling of the cave and deposits minerals on the ground.
