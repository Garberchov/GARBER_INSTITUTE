### 15.1: Levels of Ecology
 - Ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and the environment they live in, which brings us to another important term that's used frequently in ecology: the environment, which is the set of conditions that surround an organism. Environmental factors include temperature, light, water, air, soil and nutrients that surround an organism. An environment can be very large and even refer to the entire Earth. An environment can also be very small. For example, the environment of an intracellular parasite can be as small as a single host cell. In most cases, when the term environment is used in the context of ecology, it refers to all the abiotic factors, or nonliving environmental factors that surround an organism. However, in the case of organisms that live inside other organisms, we can't really be strict about this particular definition because the tissue surrounding these organisms is living, but that still doesn't exclude the tissue from being a part of the environment nonetheless.
 - At the most basic level, we have organismal ecology, which is the interactions a single organism has with its environment.
 - All organisms in a particular geographic area that belong to the same species make up a population. Population ecology is the study of how populations interact with the environment.
 - A community is made up of all the populations of different species that live in a particular area. Community ecology is the study of how communities interact with the environment.
 - Ecosystem ecology is the study of how the living and nonliving components of an ecosystem interact with each other. An ecosystem is made up of all the living organisms in a particular area and the nonliving components of the environment, such as the atmosphere, soil, water and sunlight. Ecosystems can be very small, such as a pond, or very large, and can span thousands of square kilometers, such as a forest.
 - A biosphere is the global ecosystem, which is the sum of all the planet's ecosystems and landscapes. The biosphere is the highest level of ecological organization and includes all the living organisms on Earth and the nonliving components with which they interact.

### 15.2: Ecosystem, Habitat & Niche
 - An ecosystem is made up of all the living organisms in a particular area and the nonliving components of the environment, such as the atmosphere, soil, water and sunlight. Ecosystems can be very small, such as a pond, or very large, and can span thousands of square kilometers, such as a forest.
 - A habitat is the specific environment in which an organism lives. A habitat can be as small as the area under a rock or as large as the entire Amazon rainforest. A habitat can be very specific, such as the inside of a particular type of flower, or very general, such as the open ocean.
 - A niche is the role an organism plays in its environment. It includes the organism's habitat, the food it eats, the way it gets its food, and the other organisms it interacts with. The niche of an organism is like its job. Just as a person can have a job that involves many different tasks, an organism's niche can involve many different interactions with other organisms and the environment. The niche of an organism is a very important concept in ecology because it helps us understand how organisms interact with each other and their environment. How niches play off each other is a key factor in determining the structure and function of ecosystems.
 - Population density is the number of individuals of a population that live in a particular area. This is effected by a variety of factors, including the availability of food, the presence of predators, and the presence of disease. The population density of a species can have a big impact on the structure and function of an ecosystem. There are far more factors that can affect population density, but these are just a few examples.
