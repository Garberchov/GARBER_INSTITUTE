#### 2.1: Geologic Time Scale: Eons, Eras, Periods, Epochs
 - Time is subdivided into major measurement units called eons, eras, periods, and epochs. 
 - The largest unit of time is the eon. 
 - Geologists agree that there are two major eons: The Precambrian eon and the Phanerozoic eon. The Precambrian goes from the formation of the Earth to the first multicellular organisms. The Phanerozoic eon goes from the first multicellular organisms to the present day. 
 - Eons are subdivided into eras. There are three eras in the Phanerozoic eon: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. We are currently in the Cenozoic era.
 - The next smallest unit of time is the period, which spans no more than 100 million years. We are currently in the Quaternary period.
 - The smallest unit of time is the epoch, we are currently in the Holocene epoch which began about 12,000 years ago.

#### 2.2. Theories of Geological Evolution 
 - Catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features are mostly due to violent, large-scale events that occur suddenly in Earth's history. 
 - Uniformitarianism is the theory that Earth's features are mostly due to slow, gradual processes that have been at work for a very long time.

#### 2.3. Relative and Numerical Geologic Dating 
 - Relative dating is the process of determining whether an object or event is older or younger than other objects or events.
 - Numerical dating is the process of determining the actual age of an object or event.

#### 2.4. Relative Dating
 - (And not in the way you think)
 - In order to establish relative dates, geologists must make an initial assumption about the way rock strata are formed. It's called the Principle of Original Horizontality, and it just means what it sounds like: that all rock layers were originally horizontal. Of course, it only applies to sedimentary rocks.
 - Once we assume that all rock layers were originally horizontal, we can make another assumption: that the oldest rock layers are furthest toward the bottom, and the youngest rock layers are closest to the top. This rule is called the Law of Superposition.
 - Sometimes, geologists find strange things inside the strata, like chunks of metamorphic or igneous rock. These items are called inclusions - foreign bodies of rock or mineral enclosed within another rock. Because the sedimentary rock had to have formed around the object for it to be encased within the layers, geologists can establish relative dates between the inclusions and the surrounding rock. Inclusions are always older than the sedimentary rock within which they are found.
 - Other times, geologists discover patterns in rock layers that give them confusing information. There may be a layer missing in the strata, or a set of sedimentary rock on top of metamorphic rock. These interfaces between discontinuous layers of rock are called unconformities. They complicate the task of relative dating, because they don't give an accurate picture of what happened in geologic history.
