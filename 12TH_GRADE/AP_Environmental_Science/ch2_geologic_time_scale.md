#### 2.1: Geologic Time Scale: Eons, Eras, Periods, Epochs
 - Time is subdivided into major measurement units called eons, eras, periods, and epochs. 
 - The largest unit of time is the eon. 
 - Geologists agree that there are two major eons: The Precambrian eon and the Phanerozoic eon. The Precambrian goes from the formation of the Earth to the first multicellular organisms. The Phanerozoic eon goes from the first multicellular organisms to the present day. 
 - Eons are subdivided into eras. There are three eras in the Phanerozoic eon: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. We are currently in the Cenozoic era.
 - The next smallest unit of time is the period, which spans no more than 100 million years. We are currently in the Quaternary period.
 - The smallest unit of time is the epoch, we are currently in the Holocene epoch which began about 12,000 years ago.
