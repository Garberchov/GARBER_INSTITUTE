### Chapter 6 - The Atmosphere and the Environment

#### 6.1 - The Atmosphere
 - The atmosphere is a thin layer of gases held to Earth by gravity.
 - It is made up of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases.
 - 0.9% of that 1% is argon, and the rest is *EVERYTHING ELSE* - the greenhouse effect ic caused by that less than 0.1% of the atmosphere.
 - Some people have taken that small percentage to mean that it can't possibly cause the kind of catastrophic climate change that we're seeing today, but that's not true, because the greenhouse effect is a *feedback loop*.

#### 6.2. - Structure of the Atmosphere
 - There are four layers of the atmosphere:
   - The troposphere, which is the layer closest to the Earth's surface - it contains most of the atmosphere's mass and is where most of the weather occurs, and it extends about 14.5 kilometers
   - The stratosphere, which is the layer above the troposphere - it extends 40 kilometers past the troposphere
   - The mesosphere, which is the layer above the stratosphere - it extends 30-40 kilometers from the stratosphere
   - The thermosphere, which is the layer above the mesosphere - it extends more than 600 kilometers from the mesosphere


#### 6.4. Temperature, Clouds, Wind, Humidity
 - There are five factors that determine the state and condition of the atmosphere and, therefore, influence and determine the weather. They include:
    - temperature
    - air pressure
    - humidity
    - cloudiness
    - wind
 - The first of these air mass factors that determines weather is temperature. Temperature is the amount of heat contained in an object, in this case, the air. The amount of heat in the air determines the speed of the molecules in the air. The more heat, the faster the molecules move, raising the temperature. The heat in the atmosphere comes from the sun and varies at different levels in the atmosphere. The layers of the atmosphere are determined generally by their temperature. 
 - Air pressure is simply the amount of air that is pushing down on you from the atmosphere "on top" of you. That is why when you climb a mountain, you need air tanks.
 - The third factor that can determine the weather is if a place is experiencing humidity. Humidity is a measure of the water content of the air mass. The amount of moisture in the air can vary widely depending on the conditions. In the winter, air is generally cooler and drier, whereas in the summer when air is warmer, it can hold more moisture. That's what gives it that sticky, soupy feeling of a very humid day. The amount of moisture can be seen when it condenses as fog. A foggy morning occurs when the moisture in the air becomes cool enough to condense and form tiny drops in the air.
 - Clouds are simply tiny drops of water or ice that form in the atmosphere.
 - Finally, wind can be a factor determining weather, particularly its speed and direction. Wind is a process of movement of air that occurs due to the uneven heating of the Earth's surface. Different parts of the Earth heat at different rates depending on factors like the amount of water present, snow cover and vegetation. Areas that heat up faster have air that rises, and air from cooler regions moves in to replace it, causing wind. The bigger the temperature differential, the stronger the wind. This movement of air can move air masses and bring clouds or other weather-related factors with it. Wind speed is measured with an anemometer and is measured in miles per hour.


#### 6.5. Climate Classification 
 - Though no location on Earth will have exactly the same climate as another, many do have very similar climatic characteristics. In fact, these characteristics were first classified in 1884 by a Russian-German climatologist named Wladimir Köppen. Named after its founder, the Köppen Climate Classification system categorizes Earth's climates into five major groups based on the native vegetation present. He based his classification system on plants because he felt that they are the best representative of the local temperature, precipitation and other variables that contribute to climate.
 - Group A, our first climate classification, is also known as 'humid tropical.' This is what you would expect at the equator - a warm, wet climate. 
 - Group B is the next climate classification, one step away from the equator both north and south. This is also known as the 'dry' group because there is little moisture in the air here. Not surprisingly, we find the world's great deserts in this region, like the Sahara in Africa and the Great Victoria in Australia
 - Group C is our next classification, now two steps away from the equator. This group is also known as the 'humid middle latitude with mild winters' region. So, think of Group C for 'cold' since these regions do have winters (unlike Groups A and B). It's called humid because there's moisture in the air, middle latitude because it is about mid-way between the equator and the polar region (either north or south) and mild winters because while it may get cold and snowy, they are still fairly tolerable conditions. These areas have wonderful seasonal changes and occur in places like the central U.S., southern Europe and central South America.
 - Group D is our second to last classification, so we're getting pretty close to the poles now. While closer to the poles, we're still in somewhat middle latitudes here, and the air is still moist, but man, these winters really are cold! Think of places like northern Canada and Siberia and you'll likely understand why these get the 'severe winter' classification.
 - Our final group is Group E, the polar group.You can't go any farther than the poles! Like Group A, there's no seasonal change here but on quite the opposite end of the spectrum.
