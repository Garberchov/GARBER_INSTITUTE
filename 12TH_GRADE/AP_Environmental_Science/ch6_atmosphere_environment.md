### Chapter 6 - The Atmosphere and the Environment

#### 6.1 - The Atmosphere
 - The atmosphere is a thin layer of gases held to Earth by gravity.
 - It is made up of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases.
 - 0.9% of that 1% is argon, and the rest is *EVERYTHING ELSE* - the greenhouse effect ic caused by that less than 0.1% of the atmosphere.
 - Some people have taken that small percentage to mean that it can't possibly cause the kind of catastrophic climate change that we're seeing today, but that's not true, because the greenhouse effect is a *feedback loop*.

#### 6.2. - Structure of the Atmosphere
 - There are four layers of the atmosphere:
   - The troposphere, which is the layer closest to the Earth's surface - it contains most of the atmosphere's mass and is where most of the weather occurs, and it extends about 14.5 kilometers
   - The stratosphere, which is the layer above the troposphere - it extends 40 kilometers past the troposphere
   - The mesosphere, which is the layer above the stratosphere - it extends 30-40 kilometers from the stratosphere
   - The thermosphere, which is the layer above the mesosphere - it extends more than 600 kilometers from the mesosphere
