#### 13.1 Carbon & Nitrogen Cycles
 - One of the ways that nature recycles matter is through the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle is carbon cycling through the global environment. Carbon is a chemical element and a key component of many systems in the biosphere, from acting as part of the earth's thermostat to being one of the key elements in photosynthesis, which is when plants make sugars for energy.
 - In order for the ecosystem to function properly, all parts need an adequate supply of carbon. This is usually not a problem since nature is efficient at carbon cycling. Since the process is a cycle, we need to pick some place to begin.
 - 0.038% of the athmosphere is carbon dioxide, which while it doesn't seem like a lot is absolutely essential for the functioning of the ecosystem. There are two ways for carbon to be removed from the atmosphere. The first is through photosynthesis, where plants take in CO2, water and sunlight to create sugars for energy, and oxygen gas emerges as a by-product. Once inside plants, carbon moves through food chains, where organisms become nutrients including herbivores, carnivores and ultimately, decomposers. Through living organisms, carbon is either re-released back into the atmosphere through respiration (where organisms use oxygen to generate energy from nutrients and produce carbon dioxide as waste), released by combustion (the process of burning something) or broken down into the soil as part of the organism's body. Once buried in the soil, carbon can be converted into fossil fuels over long periods of time and then also reenter the atmosphere by combustion.
 - If carbon from the atmosphere does not enter a terrestrial (or land) plant by photosynthesis, it can dissolve in the ocean. Here it can be taken up by marine plants through photosynthesis - just like in land plants - or it can be incorporated into sediments. Marine organisms can also take up dissolved carbon molecules and use that along with calcium in the seawater to make calcium carbonate, which is a major component of the shells and skeletons of marine organisms.
 - When these organisms die, their shells and bones settle to the bottom of the ocean, where they can be covered up and remain for long periods of time. Under great pressure from the water and sediment, these shells break down and form limestone rock.
 - Limestone is the largest storage reservoir of carbon on the earth. Once formed into limestone, carbon usually stays locked in the rock. However, it can also dissolve very slowly to be released as carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, or, if the limestone is exposed to weathering and dissolved by acid rain, be released as carbon dioxide. This completes the cycle, returning all carbon back to the atmosphere where it began. 
 - Like carbon, nitrogen also has always been present on the earth, and in the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen cycles through the global environment. Nitrogen is also a chemical element, and it is the most abundant element in the atmosphere, making up 78% of the atmosphere. Nitrogen is very unreactive with other elements, and it cannot be used directly as a nutrient by plants and animals the way oxygen or carbon can. However, nitrogen can be converted into forms usable by plants and animals, either by lightning or bacteria. Once converted to usable forms, nitrogen is able to cycle the rest of the way through the ecosystem.
 - In a process known as nitrogen fixation, special bacteria can convert nitrogen gas in the atmosphere directly into ammonia, which is an important nutrient for plants. In this manner, nitrogen enters the ecosystem from the atmosphere. This conversion is performed either by cyanobacteria in the soil or by a bacteria that lives in the roots of certain plants known as legumes, such as soybeans or alfalfa. This is why soybeans and alfalfa are often used as cover crops, because they can help to replenish nitrogen in the soil.
 - Once nitrogen is split into nitrates or fixed by bacteria, plant roots can absorb nitrogen compounds in a process known as assimilation. Once absorbed, DNA, proteins and amino acids are the main nitrogen-containing compounds in the plant. Animals also need nitrogen to make these same compounds, so they get it from the food they eat, like plants or other animals. Nitrogen is then held in the body in these organisms until they die. After death, decomposers, like fungus and bacteria, convert the nitrogen from the proteins, DNA and other compounds back into ammonia substances and eventually to nitrogen gas to be used again.
 - This is a closed-cycle, meaning that nitrogen is not lost from the ecosystem.

#### 13.2. Properties of Water
 - The chemical formula for water is H20, which means that it is made up of 2 hydrogens and 1 oxygen. These different parts of the molecule are held together by covalent bonds.
 - The hydrogen bonds in water make the molecules cohesive, which means they stick together really well. The cohesion of water is much stronger than most other liquids, and this is very important. For example, water and nutrients can be transported from tree roots to other parts of the plant with cohesion.
 - Water also has fairly high surface tension, which is the ability of water to resist external forces. This is why water forms droplets when it is on a surface, it "coheres" on top of a penny, and it can support small insects like water striders.
 - More important than its physical properties are its interior physics properties. Why do coastal areas tend to have more consistent temperatures throughout the year while areas that are farther inland have more extreme highs and lows? This is due to water's high specific heat capacity. Specific heat capacity is the resistance to temperature change. It takes a lot of energy to change the temperature of water because it takes a lot of energy to break the hydrogen bonds. Water absorbs and stores a large amount of heat from the sun and, as it cools, it releases this heat into the air that travels onto land. So in winter, when the air is colder than the water, the air literally picks up the water's heat as it passes over it onto land and warms it. Likewise, in the summer when the air is hotter than the water, the air cools off as it travels past the ocean to land and cools the shore. 
 - We can find water on Earth in three different forms: solid, liquid and gas. Most things become more dense when they cool because their molecules are condensing together, and become less dense when they heat up because their molecules are moving farther apart from each other. Do you think water behaves like this? It sure doesn't! When water becomes cooler and freezes, it actually expands, because each water molecule connects to its neighboring water molecules with hydrogen bonds. This creates a crystal-shaped structure between the molecules, which spreads them out and increases the volume. And since this makes ice less dense, this means it floats on top of water.
