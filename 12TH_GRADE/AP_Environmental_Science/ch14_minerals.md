### Chapter 14: Minerals

#### 14.1. Minerals
 - In order for something to be a mineral, it must first meet four criteria: it must be solid, naturally formed, have a unique and specific chemical composition, and have a crystalline structure.
 - Minerals are classified by their chemical composition and crystalline structure. These two features occur on a microscopic level, but we can see them in other ways because they determine a mineral's observable physical properties. In other words, what appears to us on the outside is determined by what's on the inside.
 - There are seven physical properties of minerals that we can observe: crystal form, hardness, fracture or cleavage, luster, color, streak, and density.
 - Crystal form is the outward expression of the arrangement of atoms inside a mineral.  Normally, what you see is a salt cube, but if you were to break this cube down into smaller parts, it would simply break into smaller and smaller cubes because that is how the atoms are arranged.
 - Hardness is how resistant a mineral is to scratching, not how easily it breaks. Hardness depends on the bonds within the mineral, so the stronger the bonds, the harder the mineral. Mineral hardness is measured on the Mohs scale of hardness, which compares the hardness of different minerals.
 - Fracture and cleavage describe how a mineral breaks. Some minerals break very nicely along smooth planes, and this is called cleavage. Minerals that break this way do so because their atoms are arranged so that they break apart from each other along these planes. Mica is an example of a mineral that has cleavage. If a mineral fractures, it breaks in uneven ways that are not flat or parallel. Again, these minerals break like this because that's how their atoms are arranged.
 - Luster is simply the reflectivity of a mineral. Some have a metallic luster, which is like a shiny piece of aluminum, or non-metallic luster, which is not shiny and is generally dull.
 - Some minerals can be identified by their color, but some minerals, such as quartz, come in many colors. Streak is often a better way to identify a mineral, which is the color that shows up when a mineral is scraped across an unglazed porcelain plate. However, minerals with non-metallic luster all have a white streak, so this is really only helpful for minerals with a metallic luster.
 - Finally, the density is how tightly packed the material of the mineral is. Minerals that are more dense have more tightly packed atoms than those that are less dense.
 - Minerals are a huge percentage of what we use every day. Precious stones and gemstones are things that you are likely quite familiar with. They are rubies, diamonds, emeralds and the like. Metals, like gold, silver, copper, lead, iron and zinc, are extracted from ore, and the process of extracting these minerals is called metallurgy.


#### 14.3. Extraction and Processing of Minerals
 - The process of extracting minerals from the Earth is called mining. There are two types of mining: surface mining and underground mining, and both have significant environmental impacts if not done responsibly(and even if they are).
 - Surface mining is exactly what it sounds like, removing the top layer of the Earth to get to the minerals underneath. When the ore deposits are huge(like for some coal mining), open-pit mining is used. This is when a large hole is dug and the ore is removed. Strip mining is similar, but is basically just a smaller "line" of open-pit mining. The material that is cast aside here is called overburden, and is often dumped into big piles called spoil banks.
 - Underground mining is used when the ore deposits are not as easily accessible. This is done by digging shafts and tunnels to get to the ore. This is a very dangerous job, and the miners are at risk of cave-ins, explosions, and exposure to toxic gases.
 - One way is to blast apart the material and then send the ore pieces up to the surface in carts. Another method is longwall mining, which is when coal is sheared from the wall and collected on a conveyor belt, much like a potato peeler shears away layers of a potato. This is a very efficient way of extracting coal from an underground mine. Another method is solution mining, which is when hot water is injected into the ore to dissolve it. 
 - Subsurface mining is actually less disruptive to the earth and produces less waste than surface mining, but it's also much less effective and more dangerous. Many workers die in mine collapses, which then also leaves behind a large hole from caving in of the ground above. Water may leak into the mine and dissolve toxic chemicals that may leak into aquifers and drinking water supplies. Explosions in old mining tunnels may also occur because the natural gas underground ignites very easily.
 - Besides erosion problems and changes to the landscape, mining also causes pollution in the air and water. Abandoned coal mines lead to acid mine drainage, which is water that is full of metals and toxins. Much like hot water dripping through coffee in a filter, rainwater picks up the harmful components in the ground and carries them off as surface and groundwater runoff. This runoff can end up in streams, rivers and lakes that are nearby.
 - Also, smelting is how we extract metals from their ores. This is done by heating the ore to high temperatures and then separating the metal from the waste material. This process releases a lot of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide and heavy metals. The waste material is called slag, and it is often dumped into piles that can leach heavy metals into the environment.

#### 14.5. Crystal Formation Shapes
 - At the microscopic level, a crystal is a solid formed by regularly-repeating patterns of molecules that are connected together. Now, not all solids are crystals. In a non-crystal solid, the arrangement of the molecules is random throughout the material; it's not regular. Still, at the microscopic level, the crystal is characterized by the unit cell, which is a collection of molecules repeated in exactly the same arrangement throughout the entire material.
 - At the macroscopic level, geologists use the term "crystal shape" or "crystal habit" to describe the visible external shape of a sample of a material. There are two general types of crystal shapes: euhedral and anhedral. Euhedral crystals are those that have well-formed, sharp, and distinct edges and faces. Anhedral crystals are those that do not have well-formed faces and edges. They are irregular in shape and are often found in a mass of other crystals.
 - Diamonds are euhedral crystals, and they have octahedral shapes. Magnetite is another example of a mineral that has euhedral crystals, and they have octahedral shapes as well. 
 - Now let's move on to the crystal habits that don't have a regular geometric shape. Some minerals rarely develop perfect geometric forms at the surface. However, other characteristics can be helpful in identification of these minerals. For example, kyanite has a bladed habit, as its crystals are elongated and flattened in one direction, much like the blade of a knife.
 - Tourmaline has a prismatic, or prism-like habit, as the crystals are prism-like; that is, elongated but not flattened. Still, other minerals are banded, as they have stripes or bands of different colors or different textures. Rhodochrosite is a banded mineral as it has characteristic layered texture and color. Hematite forms an interesting botryoidal habit that resembles a cluster of grapes.

#### 14.6. Mineral Strength
 - Tenacity refers to a mineral's toughness or resistance to breaking or being deformed. Minerals such as halite, calcite and fluorite are brittle, as their molecules are held together by weak ionic bonds. Therefore, these minerals shatter when they're struck.
 - Metallic minerals, such as copper and gold, are said to be malleable, as they are easily hammered into different forms. Minerals such as talc and gypsum can be cut into thin sheets or sections and are said to be sectile (like section). Malleable and sectile minerals, when refined, can be hammered or pressed into very thin sheets or drawn into wires. This is useful for many industrial applications, such as in the production of electrical wiring.
 - Mica is an example of a mineral that is elastic, as it reforms its original shape after a stress is released. Mica is used to make washers, as it is not only elastic but heat-resistant as well. Let me quickly note that mica is not the same as Formica, which is manufactured material commonly used on countertops. Interestingly, however, Formica is used as a substitute for mica in the industry, hence the name 'for - mica.'
 - You may have heard it said that diamonds are the hardest natural mineral known. While that may be true, what does it mean to say that one substance is harder than another? Hardness is the resistance of a mineral to scratching, and it is one of the more useful diagnostic properties. Relative hardness is easy to determine. All you have to do is rub one substance against the other. The substance that is not scratched is harder.
 - The Mohs scale is a relative ranking of the hadness of ten different minerals, from talc(1) to diamond(10). Artificial materials can be harder than diamond, but they are not naturally occuring so not included here.
 - Anything between could be considered a ".5" on the scale, or if something is between an integer and a half, it could be considered a ".25" or ".75" on the scale. It isn't a perfect system, but it's a good way to get a rough idea of how hard a mineral is.
 - Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to cleave or break along flat planes of weak bonding. No dirty jokes here. 
 - While some minerals exhibit cleavage, all minerals exhibit fracture . Fracture is the shape and texture of the surface formed when a mineral is broken or fractured. Fracture is an important diagnostic property, as minerals fracture the same way regardless of how they are broken. 
 - Most minerals, like magnetite, have an irregular fracture, as they break into rough surfaces, random shapes, almost fractal-like. Some minerals, like quartz, have a conchoidal fracture, which is a smooth, curved surface that looks like the inside of a seashell. This is because the mineral breaks along curved surfaces, and it's a good way to identify quartz.

#### 14.8. Silicate Minerals
 - Silicates make up for more than 90% of Earth's crust, and they are hugely abundant(well, most of them).
 - All silicates have the same fundamental building blocks, the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron. This is a pyramid with a silicon atom in the center and four oxygen atoms at the corners. The tetrahedra can be linked together in a variety of ways, and the way they are linked determines the structure of the silicate mineral.
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/si04.png)
 - Most silicates are formed as molten rock cools and crystallizes. The conditions and the environment during which the cooling occurs will determine the type of silicate formed. Some silicates, for example, quartz, are formed near the surface of the earth, where there is low temperature and low pressure. Other silicates, such as olivine, form deeper, under conditions of higher temperature and higher pressure.
 - There are other factors, environmental and chemical, that can affect the formation but heat and pressure are the main ones.
 - Feldspars are by far the most common silicate mineral, making up more than half of the earth's crust. Feldspars are distinguished by their three-dimensional arrangement of the tetrahedra held together by various different cations. They are named for the cation present; for example, potassium feldspar contains potassium.
 - Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the earth's crust, and it is the only common mineral made completely of silicon and oxygen. Now, like feldspar, quartz is comprised of a three-dimensional arrangement of the tetrahedra, but it lacks cations.
 - While feldspars and quartz comprise the bulk of the silicates, and thus the bulk of the earth's crust, other less-common silicates are important. For example, micas, such as muscovite, are characterized by an arrangement of the tetrahedra in sheets. Therefore, micas can be cleaved into thin sheets of material, as the bonds holding the groups of tetrahedra together are not as strong as the bonds holding the silicon and the oxygen together within a tetrahedron. Amphiboles, such as hornblende found in granite, are formed from chains of tetrahedra. Now, the olivine group, as previously mentioned, is composed of millions of independent tetrahedra.

#### 14.9. Non-Silicate Minerals
 - Minerals can be classified as either silicate - that is, containing silicon and oxygen - or non-silicate - that is, lacking silicon. While most of the earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, several non-silicate minerals are of great importance.
 - First, and most notable, are carbonates. Carbonates are minerals that contain the carbonate ion, CO3^2-. The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, which is the primary mineral in limestone and marble. Calcite is also the primary mineral in cave formations, such as stalactites and stalagmites. Dolomite is another important carbonate mineral, and it is the primary mineral in the rock dolostone. Magnesium is another carbonate mineral, and is highly flamable but also very important for industrial applications like in the production of magnesium metal or steel with a high magnesium content.
 - Sulfates are another important non-silicate mineral group. Sulfates contain the sulfate ion, SO4^2 and a cation. The most common mineral here is gypsum, which is used in the production of plaster, drywall, cement, and many other applications. Halite, also known as rock salt, is another important non-silicate mineral. When refined/processed, it is also known as table salt.

#### 14.10. Rocks vs Minerals
 - A mineral is a solid, inorganic, naturally-formed substance that has a crystalline structure and specific chemical composition. 
 -  Natural solids can be familiar things like sand, granite, salt and wood. Our definition says that minerals are inorganic, which means that they do not consist of tissues from living things. So, that means that wood is not a mineral.
 - It also says that minerals have a crystalline structure. That means that the component atoms of the substance have a repeating, 3-dimensional arrangement. Above is a picture showing how the atoms of salt are arranged. Salt is also called sodium chloride because it is made of two types of atoms: sodium and chlorine. The sodium and chlorine atoms are put together in a very specific, 3-dimensional lattice that repeats over and over until you get to the end of the salt crystal. 
 - Granite is a rock, not a mineral. Granite is a solid, formed naturally in the earth, but it does not have a specific chemical composition, and it is not a crystalline structure. It is a mixture of minerals.
 - A rock is a solid, inorganic, naturally-formed substance without a particular atomic structure or chemical composition. It's probably easier to just remember that rocks are made up of two or more minerals. Examples of rocks include granite, limestone, marble, pumice, obsidian, sandstone, shale and slate. Each of these rocks consists of several different minerals, which are mixed up inside the rock through a variety of geologic processes.
 - For example, granite is a mostly combined of quartz, feldspar, and mica. Each of these minerals can be found alone in nature, but here, they are mixed up inside of the rock. Sometimes you see large chunks of one of these minerals inside of the granite. But, when you take the stone as a whole, you have to call it a rock.
 - Other rocks are much finer grained than granite, so it's not easy to spot the different minerals. Slate is a rock that was made from clay, and clay is composed of tiny, tiny particles. Those particles can be minerals like quartz, pyrite, apatite, muscovite, feldspar, kaolinite, biotite, tourmaline - the list goes on! But, you can't see these minerals inside of a slate rock. The slate looks all the same color and texture. Still, it's not a mineral because it has no regular atomic structure or chemical composition. Rocks are made of minerals, and minerals stand alone.


#### 14.11 Rock Life Cycle
 - When the earth was first created, the materials that it made were so hot from the contractions that formed the planet and from the heat generated by the core that the outer layers were mostly liquid. Over time, it slowly cooled, and a hard crust formed on the outer surface. This was much like the thin layer of ice that first forms over a pond when the temperature dips below freezing. And just as there is liquid under the layer of ice, there is still liquid magma flowing under the crust. As this happened, a cycle of events began to be put into place that causes changes in the rocks that exist on the earth. This cycle is known as the rock cycle. The rock cycle is a model used to describe the creation, alteration, and destruction of the rocks that form from magma.
 - ONCE AGAIN, NOTHING IS CREATED OR DESTROYED, ONLY CHANGED. ENERGY IS MATTER, MATTER IS ENERGY.
 - The total length of the rock cycle can take from thousands to possibly millions of years. The cycle is made up of three main types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The cycle starts with the formation of igneous rocks. These rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma. Magma is molten rock that is found beneath the earth's surface. When magma cools, it forms solid rock. This is the first step in the rock cycle.
 - All magma solidifing becomes igneous rocks, which can either be extrusive -- on the surface -- or instrusive -- below the surface. The most common type of intrusive rock is granite, recognized by its pink or grey color flecked with light- and dark-colored mineral specks. Igneous rocks are constantly being formed on the earth whenever magma leaks to the surface through cracks or erupts in volcanoes.
 - Yes, Crystal, rocks that are exposed to the weathering nature of the elements can be broken apart. Small grains of exposed rock can be broken off by the action of wind and water or broken apart as water freezes in cracks. This can affect any type of rock, not just igneous. As time passes, these grains of rock accumulate in the slow currents in rivers or river mouths, low areas, or other quiets spots.
 - As sediment piles up, the first sediments get buried deeper and are subjected to increased heat and pressure. Sometimes water will flow through the sediment, dissolving and redepositing glue-like substances to bind the grains together into layers. Rock made from eroded material broken off other rocks and cemented together is called sedimentary rock. One of the best examples of sedimentary rock is the layers that are seen in the Grand Canyon.
 - The third type, metamorphic rock, literally means "change" and "form". Metamorphic rocks are rocks that are transformed into new substances under intense heat and pressure. In certain conditions, igneous or sedimentary rocks can be changed into different rocks under intense heat and pressure. These rocks literally change into new substances very different from their old ones.
 - This usually happens as rocks are buried deep within the crust. One of the most common metamorphic rocks is marble. Marble begins as the sedimentary rock known as limestone, and then, because of intense heat and pressure, it changes into marble, known for its many uses in sculpture and architecture.'

#### 14.12. Three Major Types of Rocks
 - There are three fundamentally different types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary rock, metamorphic rock.
 - Igneous rocks are formed from the solidification of magma. Igneous rock that forms at the surface of the earth is referred to as extrusive or volcanic rock. These are named after the fire god, Vulcan. Basalt is a good example of extrusive igneous rock. Igneous rock formed before it reaches the earth's surface is named intrusive or plutonic after the god of the lower world, Pluto. These rocks cool over long periods of time and, thus, develop large crystal structures, as we see in granite. Some intrusive rocks are subsequently exposed to the surface - but only after uplifting or erosion of the earth's surface, otherwise they would remain buried. 
 - While igneous rocks make up the bulk of the earth's crust, they're often covered by relatively thin sheets of sedimentary rock. As the name suggests, sedimentary rock is formed from sediments or debris transported by liquid water, ice, or wind that become compacted and cemented together.
 - Sedimentary rock can form as solid particles from weathered rocks. These particles are called detritus, and detrital sedimentary rocks are accumulations of detritus. Therefore, the source of sediment for detrital sedimentary rocks is weathered rock from another form. For example, particles of sand from other rocks can form sandstone, and mud can form shale, which is the most common form of sedimentary rock. Chemical sedimentary rocks are derived from material carried in solution to lakes and oceans. Under certain conditions, the material precipitates out of the solution and forms a solid mass. Limestone is a good example of a chemical sedimentary rock.
 - Now in this context, metamorphism is the transformation of one rock into another. Like sedimentary rock, metamorphic rock is a secondary rock. Metamorphic rocks are formed from pre-existing igneous, sedimentary, and even other metamorphic rocks. In short, any rock can become a metamorphic rock. How does this happen? Everything on earth, including rocks, tends towards what we call a stable state, that is, its lowest energy. Environmental change can cause rock to become unstable. For example, rocks that become buried deep under the earth are under tons of earth and exposed to increased temperature and pressure. Common metamorphic rocks include slate and marble. 


 #### 14.13 Soil Composition
  - It takes a very long time to make soil, sometimes a thousand years or more. Basically, when surface rocks break down, they mix with decaying organic material, like plants and animals. As this organic material breaks down, it returns nutrients back to the ground, which provides food for plants. Specifically, there are five main factors that create soil: parent material, climate, biology, topography and time.
 - Let's start with parent material. This is the material that new soil forms from. Parent material includes both mineral and organic material. The organic material is usually very dark and spongy, and this is also known as humus(not that kind of humus). The mineral material comes from sediments and weathered rocks, and the type of mineral material present helps determine which type of soil will form and how long it will take to form.
 - Climate has a major effect on soil composition, precipitation, temperature, wind, moisture all affect how soil forms and what physical and chemical properties it will have.
 - Soil formation is also impacted by biological influences such as plants, animals, bacteria and fungi. As we saw before, plants help recycle nutrients by decaying as well as by taking up nutrients. Plants also put down roots into the soil, which helps anchor the soil in place and prevent erosion.
 - Topography will affect the steepness of the land, and if it is very steep, more runoff will occur and the soil will be more mineral-rich than organic material if it were flatter.
 - As soil forms, it becomes sorted. Horizons develop, which are the layers of soil with distinct characteristics that are parallel to the surface of the ground. To determine the types of soil present, scientists will use a soil profile, which is a vertical section of soil from the surface. There is no limit to the number of horizons a soil profile can have, but there are six major horizons that are typically used to describe the soils in a profile.
 - The uppermost, with branches, leaves, and animal waste is called $O$, the $A$ horizon is the top level of soil underground so it is called topsoil. It contians inorganic mineral components and organic matter from above. The $E$ horizon is called the eluviation horizon, where minerals and organic matter are leached out by water down into lower horizons. Below that is the $B$ horizon, which is where the leached materials end up, and it is called subsoil. Below that is $C$ which is the parent material, and below that is $R$, which is the bedrock.

#### 14.14 Soil Types
 - There are three main soil types: sand, silt, and clay. Sand is actually just small particles of weathered rock, it is fairly coarse so water is able to drain through it easily. Silt is very fine sand, and it will hold water better than sand. It is almost flour like in consistency. Clay is the finest particle of all, and it holds water the best. It is very sticky, and when dry, it is very hard and difficult to break apart. 
 - The soil structure is based on the arrangement of individual particles of sand, silt and clay. When we have these individual soil particles bound together, they form soil aggregates. These aggregates form distinct shapes, and we want to know about these shapes because they tell us how easily water will penetrate down through soil.
 - For example, if the soil structure is granular, then it is made up of small crumbs of soil. Water will easily drain down past these small structures, and therefore, granular structure is a good medium for drainage and aeration. However, if the soil structure is platy, then we see a horizontal plate-like structure to the soil particles. This makes water draining down from the surface take a windy, slow path around the plates, making for poor water and air circulation. Platy structure is common in highly compacted soil, such as forest soil and lake sedimentation.
 - We also have columnar or prismatic structures, which have long vertical dimensions that look like columns of soil. These structures are very dense, and penetrating water has to work fairly hard to travel through this structure. Blocky structure is, as you might have guessed, a block-like structure.
