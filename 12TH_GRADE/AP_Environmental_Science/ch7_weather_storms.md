#### 7.1 Weather vs. Climate
 - The difference between weather and climate is that weather is the day to day conditions of the atmosphere, while climate is the average weather conditions over a long period of time.

#### 7.2. Factors that influence wind
 -  As warm air rises, it expands and cools. It then sinks back down to fill the space the warm air left behind. This convection current, or circulation of warm air rising and cool air sinking, has some interesting effects on wind. Wind is horizontally moving air - so, any air that moves left to right instead of up and down.

 - Pressure gradients are formed when there is a difference in pressure between two areas, when it rises in one and area and falls in another. As the air cools, it sinks back towards the warmer equatorial regions, this difference is a pressure gradient. The force that drives the air from high pressure areas to low pressure areas is called the pressure gradient force.
 - But since Earth does spin on its axis, we get multiple circulations of wind on Earth. What's especially interesting is that this rotation of Earth affects the path of wind so that it appears to deflect to the right in the Northern hemisphere and to the left in the Southern hemisphere (if you're looking down from one of the poles). This deflection of wind from Earth's rotation is called the Coriolis Effect.
 - This can be seen in a myriad of demonstrations on the internet, but it boils down to this: due to the rotation of the earth, the air is deflected by the Coriolis effect. If you were to be spinning on a merry-go-round, and you were to throw a ball to someone else on the merry-go-round, the ball would appear to curve to the right (if you were spinning clockwise) and end up directly to the person you threw it to. 
 - This is what happens to wind on Earth. As Earth rotates, all free-moving objects, like air, water, airplanes and even snowballs, appear to leave their straight-line paths. Nothing is free from the Coriolis effect!
 - The Coriolis effect also differs depending on wind speed and latitude. When wind travels faster, it gets deflected more. Objects that are higher in latitude (so, closer to the Polar Regions) deflect more than those at the equator.


#### 7.3. Weather Variables
 - There are myriad variables that affect weather, but some of the most important are pressure, temperature, and density. 
 - Pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the air above. It is measured in millibars (mb) or inches of mercury (in Hg). The average pressure at sea level is 1013.2 mb or 29.92 in Hg.
 - Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. It is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (F), Celsius (C), or Kelvin (K). People like to argue about their favorite system of measurement. 
 - Density also plays a role. The denser the air is, the more molecules there are in that given space. Obviously, the denser the air, the more collisions there will be between molecules, and the more collisions, the more energy is transferred. 
 - Adiabatic processes come about when an air parcel changes temperature without any gain or loss of heat from outside the parcel of air. All of the previous factors come together in Adiabatic processes, and they are the reason why the temperature of the air changes as it rises and sinks. In addition, factors like gravity and the composition of the air also play a role in the temperature of the air. For example, because air has weight(obviously) it is desner the closer it is to the surface of the earth. This means that the air at the surface is warmer than the air at the top of the troposphere. More than this, the composition of the air also plays a role. Water vapor can absorb heat, and the hotter the air is, the more water vapor it can hold. This is why the air is more humid in the summer than in the winter.
