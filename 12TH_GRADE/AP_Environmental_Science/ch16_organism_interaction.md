#### 16.1: Competition
 - With a graph of population density at height of two different species, you will see that each species has optimized evolutionarily(not of their own choice, of course) to be outcompete at a different altitude range. For birds, the comparison to high-altitude interceptors, TA-152, and CAS, Il-2, is a good analogy if you really like military aviation.

 - Competition between two species for the same resources is called interspecific competition, which is when two or more species in a community are competing for resources. From this graph, we can see that above 4,800 feet, species A is outcompeting species B, and below 4,800 feet, species B is outcompeting species A.
 - A second possible outcome is local extinction, which is when one species is outcompeted by another so effectively throughout the entire local habitat, that it becomes extinct in that area. For instance, in our example of the bird species, what if species A did not have an advantage at higher elevations, and instead, species B had an advantage at all elevations? In this situation, species B would likely outcompete species A to extinction in that local area.
 - Yet another possible outcome to strong interspecific competition is niche differentiation, or when similar species with similar niches become specialists in specific areas and create more than one specific niche, which allows both species to coexist.
 - What can also happen is that one species will evolve to be a specialist in a very specific niche, while another species will become a specialist in another so that they can coexist. This is called niche differentiation. It is important to remember that this is not a concious decision, but the trial-and-error of evolution over thousands and thousands of variations.
 - These sometimes very different looking, but closely related species are called ecomorphs, or populations that have recently evolved physical variations to adapt to specific microenvironments. This has allowed ecologists to categorize most species into one of six recognizable ecomorph types based on the microhabitat that each species chooses as a perch site within its environment.
 - There are grass-bush ecomorphs, trunk-ground ecomorphs, trunk ecomorphs, twig ecomorphs, trunk-crown ecomorphs, and crown-giant ecomorphs. Each of these ecomorphs has evolved to be a specialist in a specific microhabitat, which allows them to share the same general habitat without competing with each other.

#### 16.2: Predator and Prey
 - Predation is a strong, selective pressure that drives prey organisms to "find" ways to avoid being eaten. Prey organisms that are difficult to find, catch or consume are the ones that will survive and reproduce. The result is that over evolutionary time, prey organisms have developed a stunning array of strategies to avoid being eaten. Some defensive strategies are pretty obvious, and top among the list of obvious strategies is running away. Gazelle, deer, small mammals and lizards often rely on their speed and quickness to escape predators, and many birds rely on flight as their primary defensive strategy. Some organisms, like armadillos, tortoises, porcupines and thorny plants, use armor, quills and thorns to defend themselves against predators.
 - Another common defensive strategy is camouflage, which is when an organism has evolved to look like its surroundings. This can be as simple as a moth that looks like a leaf, or as complex as a stick insect that looks like a twig. Some organisms, like the octopus, can change their color and texture to match their surroundings reflexively.
 - Some organisms have resorted to chemical warfare to defend themselves against predators. The very distinctive-smelling spray of the skunk comes to mind, and the bombardier beetle sprays would-be predators with a toxic chemical in a similar fashion. Some organisms are themselves poisonous, like the poison dart frog. Instead of camoflauging themselves, they advertise their toxicity with bright colors and patterns that warn predators to stay away(NOT CONCIOUS DECISIONS, EVOLUTIONARY TRIAL AND ERROR).
 - So far, we've focused mainly on defensive strategies used by prey, but predators can also use some of the strategies already mentioned to help them capture or kill their prey. Cheetahs use speed to outrun their prey, and eagles, hawks, owls and falcons use flight to their advantage while hunting. Venomous snakes, spiders and wasps use poisons to either kill or immobilize their prey. Some predators even use mimicry to capture prey. The alligator snapping turtle uses its pink worm-like tongue as a lure to draw fish right into its mouth. The turtle will sit submerged underwater with its mouth wide open and flail its tongue around like a writhing worm. When an unsuspecting fish goes after the tongue, the turtle snaps its mouth shut and eats the fish instead.
 - When it all comes down to it, predators and prey are in a constant battle to gain an advantage that will help them survive. Whenever a predator develops an advantage that helps them acquire prey, there is selective pressure on the prey to adapt and find a way to avoid this new method of predation. The organisms that most effectively adapt to and avoid predation will survive and reproduce. It works in the opposite direction too. When prey organisms develop an effective defense against predation, predators must adapt to the change and find a way around the defense, or find a new organism to prey on. Predators that don't adapt and can't capture prey will starve to death. The end result is that predators and prey evolve in response to interactions with each other. These tight evolutionary relationships can result in coevolution, which is when two species evolve in a coordinated fashion by adapting to changes in each other.


#### 16.3: Symbiosis
 - The word symbiosis literally means 'living together,' but when we use the word symbiosis in biology, what we're really talking about is a close, long-term interaction between two different species. There are many different types of symbiotic relationships that occur in nature.
 - n many cases, both species benefit from the interaction. This type of symbiosis is called mutualism. An example of mutualism is the relationship between bullhorn acacia trees and certain species of ants. Each bullhorn acacia tree is home to a colony of stinging ants. True to its name, the tree has very large thorns that look like bull's horns. The ants hollow out the thorns and use them as shelter. In addition to providing shelter, the acacia tree also provides the ants with two food sources. The ants are incredibly territorial, and defend the tree from any herbivores that try to eat its leaves.
 - An astounding number of mutualistic relationships occur between multicellular organisms and microorganisms. Termites are only able to eat wood because they have mutualistic protozoans and bacteria in their gut that helps them digest cellulose. Inside our own bodies, there are hundreds of different types of bacteria that live just in our large intestine. Most of these are uncharacterized, but we do know a lot about E. coli, which is one of the normal bacteria found in all human large intestines. Despite is connection to food poisoning, E. coli is actually a mutualistic bacteria that helps us digest food and produce vitamins.
 - Now, let's say by some chance, a pathogenic bacteria does manage to establish itself in a person's large intestine. The host provides a habitat and food for the bacteria, but in return, the bacteria cause disease in the host. This is an example of parasitism or an association between two different species where the symbiont benefits and the host is harmed. Not all parasites have to cause disease. Lice, ticks, fleas, and leeches are all examples of parasites that don't usually cause disease directly, but they do suck blood from their host, and that is causing some harm, not to mention discomfort to their host. Parasites can also act as vectors or organisms that transmit disease-causing pathogens to other species of animals. For example, mosquitoes are vectors for the malaria parasite, and ticks are vectors for the Lyme disease bacterium. In both cases, the parasite benefits from the relationship, but the host is harmed. (All of those sci-fi parasites that take over the host's body and control them arne't real, but do illustrate the concept of parasitism - and makes for a great Stellaris event chain). Parasitism get's applied to human sociology all too often, but it's important to remember that in biology, parasitism is a very specific type of relationship between two different species - not a general term for any relationship where one party benefits at the expense of another.
 - Commensalism is an association between two different species where one species enjoys a benefit, and the other is not significantly affected. Commensalism is sometimes hard to prove because in any symbiotic relationship, the likelihood that a very closely associated organism has no effect whatsoever on the other organism is pretty unlikely. But, there are a few examples where commensalism does appear to exist. For example, the cattle egret follows cattle, water buffalo, and other large herbivores as they graze. The herbivores flush insects from the vegetation as they move, and the egrets catch and eat the insects when they leave the safety of the vegetation. In this relationship the egret benefits greatly, but there is no apparent effect on the herbivore. In effect, the egret is getting a free meal, and the herbivore isn't taking an evolutionary hit for it.
 - Amensalism is an association between two organisms of different species where one species is inhibited or killed and the other is unaffected. Amensalism can occur in a couple different ways. Most commonly, amensalism occurs through direct competition for resources. For example, if there is a small sapling that is trying to grow right next to a mature tree, the mature tree is likely to outcompete the sapling for resources. It will intercept most of the light and its mature root system will do a much better job of absorbing water and nutrients - leaving the sapling in an environment without enough light, water, or nutrients and causing it harm. However, the large tree is relatively unaffected by the presence of the sapling because it isn't blocking light to the taller tree, and the amount of water and nutrients it can absorb are so small that the mature tree will not notice the difference.

#### 16.4: Populations
 - When biologists study populations, they usually measure them in terms of population density, or the number of organisms per unit of volume or area. In some cases, the population density can be determined by simply counting the number of organisms in an area and dividing by the area. But many populations are too large, or the individuals are too hard to see or locate to directly count. In these cases, biologists must estimate the actual population density using a variety of methods. Statistics!
 - One of the biggest factors that affect populations is life history, or the sequence of events in an organism's life that relate to its survival and reproduction. An organism's life history includes factors such as number of offspring produced, frequency of reproduction, amount of care and resources dedicated to offspring and what kind of survivorship curve the organism exhibits. A survivorship curve is a graph of the number of individuals still alive at each age.
 - ![alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/survivorship-curve.jpg)
 - This curve shows three types of survivorship curves. Type I survivorship curves are characterized by high survival rates in early and middle life, with a rapid decline in survival in later life. Humans are an example of a species that exhibits a Type I survivorship curve. Type II survivorship curves are characterized by a relatively constant mortality rate throughout the organism's life. Birds are an example of a species that exhibits a Type II survivorship curve. Type III survivorship curves are characterized by very high mortality rates in early life, with a rapid decline in mortality rates in later life(mostly because most don't make it to later life). Insects are an example of a species that exhibits a Type III survivorship curve.
 - One theory that attempted to explain why organisms had such different life histories is the r/K selection theory. This theory was popular in the 1970s and 1980s and basically categorized organisms as being either r-selected species, which are short-lived species with a high growth rate that produce a large number of offspring, each of which has a low probability of survival to adulthood, or K-selected species, which are long-lived species with a slower growth rate that produce a small number of offspring into which the parents invest a lot of resources to ensure a high probability of survival to adulthood. You can think of r-selected species as those that exhibit a type III survivorship curve and K-selected species as those that exhibit a type I survivorship curve.
 - However, r/K selection theory didn't stop there. It further theorized that r-selected species were better suited to survive in an environment that was subject to frequent, dramatic changes and that K-selected species were better suited to survive in a stable environment. But the theory had several flaws. First, the theory failed to explain why both r- and K- selected organisms are found in pretty much every environment regardless of stability. Second, the theory failed to explain why some organisms displayed both r- and K- selected features. For instance, giant sequoias are among the world's largest and longest-living species, both of which are extreme cases of K-selected traits, but giant sequoias produce millions of very tiny seeds and have one of the lowest survivorship to adulthood of all species on Earth, which is an extreme r-selected feature. Finally, the theory was abandoned by most ecologists after fruit fly experiments in the 1980s and 1990s showed experimentally that r-selected traits were not selected for in unstable environments as the theory hypothesized.
 - Now, most ecologists pretty much agree that the range of life history factors that we see in nature cannot be neatly categorized into so few classes, and the number required to categorize them would make categorization meaningless.


#### 16.5: Carrying Capacity
 - In an environment with favorable conditions, unlimited resources and no predation, populations can experience rapid and exponential growth or growth of a population where the number of individuals multiplies with every successive generation. This graph shows what unlimited exponential growth would look like. However, such conditions are rarely found in natural habitats, and exponential growth is usually observed in very small organisms under experimental conditions. In their natural habitat, all populations are limited by a number of factors which can include the size of the habitat, the amount of resources available, the population size of other competing species, predation and life history.
 - ![alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/logistic-population-growth.jpg)
 - Carrying capacity is the term used by biologists to describe the maximum stable population size that a habitat can support. This population growth is logistic, because once it reaches that cap it is very hard to exceed it due to lack of resources.
 - One of the factors that determines a population's carrying capacity is its range or the geographic limits within which a population or individual lives. The larger that a population's range is, the more resources will be available to that population and the greater the carrying capacity will be if all other factors stay the same. 
 - In addition, individual organisms within a population can show one of three different patterns of dispersion or pattern of spacing of individuals within a population. A population can show uniform, clumped or random dispersion.
 -Some species of animals stay in the same location all of their lives. However, other species move from place to place. Many animal species travel in a yearly migration, which is the seasonal movement of organisms over long distances. Availability of food appears to be the most common reason for migration. For example, the annual migration of the wildebeest of the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem is timed to take advantage of the growth of grasses after seasonal rainy periods in different parts of the wildebeest range. Bird migrations also seem to be mostly motivated by availability of food. However, some migrations appear to be motivated, at least partially, by seasonal variations in temperature.
