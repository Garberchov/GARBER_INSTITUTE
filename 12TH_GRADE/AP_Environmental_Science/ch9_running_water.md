#### 9.1. Drainage Basins
 - When water falls on land, it flows downhill, and eventually into some form of water body - frequently a stream or river, which then flows into larger streams, rivers, lakes, or oceans. The area of land that drains into a particular stream or river is called a drainage basin, or watershed.
 - Drainage basins often have well-defined boundaries. The line that separates two adjacent drainage basins is called a drainage divide. Drainage divides are often steep mountain ranges or hills. When rain falls on one side of the divide, it will flow into a certain drainage basin, and if the water falls on the opposite side of the divide, it will flow into a different drainage basin. 
 - This process also creates lakes, ponds, and wetlands. If a drainage basin is large enough, it can actually encompass an entire body of water interior to it.
 - There is also a hierarchy of drainage basins, with smaller basins at high elevations are called first-order basins, larger basins that are formed by the confluence of two or more first-order basins are called second-order basins, and so on. The largest basins are called trunk streams, and they are formed by the confluence of many smaller basins.

#### 9.2. Laminar vs Turbulent Flow
 - Streamflow is often characterized by the water velocity, which is the speed at which something moves, and the direction of the flow. Based on these characteristics, water in steams can be classified as laminar or turbulent.
 - The more basic type of steamflow is referred to as laminar. Laminar streamflow is when water is organized in parallel layers and moves in an orderly manner. Water particles stay within their layer and move along the stream at that level. This structure is often possible because there are minimal rocks or other physical barriers in these types of streams.
 - The more complex type of steamflow is referred to as turbulent. Turbulent streamflow is when water does not remain within parallel layers and does not move in an orderly manner. Streams with turbulent streamflow have rocks and other physical barriers within the water. When water particles collide with these barriers, they are forced to mix between the parallel layers. Instead of water flowing in a direct line down the stream, the water moves in random and erratic directions.
 - Streams with turbulent streamflow often have high velocities, which creates more dramatic and uncontrolled water movement. These types of streams are also often quite loud because the water is colliding with barriers and being moved around more forcefully.
 - Think of white water rafting when thinking of turbulent streamflow.
