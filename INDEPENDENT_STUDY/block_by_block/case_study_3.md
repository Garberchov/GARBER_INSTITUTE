## Introduction: The League of Nations

The League of Nations was an international organization founded in 1919 after the Paris Peace Conference, largely at the behest of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. The League was established primarily as a means of preventing future wars, even stating so as its first goal in its charter, "to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, by the prescription of open ... relations between nations, by the firm establishments of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments" (League of Nations). The League was in effect a desire to remake the Concert of Europe(Lascurettes, K.), a system of international relations that had focused on the maintenance of a balance of power between the major European powers.The League was to be a more modern version of this system, with the United States as a major player, and was to be a forum for the resolution of international disputes and a means of collective security. Despite this aspiration, the League was almost immediately defunct but took two decades to die, and its failure to police the agressive actions of the Fascist powers in the 1930s gave way to the Second World War. For the purpose of learning from the League's failure in the context of designing a World Government, it is important to explore the League's lack of adoption and its lack of enforcement power.

### Note

In consideration of the time-period of its founding, and certainly of the circumstances that precipitated the First World War, it must be noted that the age of nationalism was in full swing. Nationalism, the belief that one's nation is superior to all others due to its culture, history, and language, was the predominant political philosophy[^1] of the second half of he 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. This is no longer the case, and the dominant political philosophy of the 21st century is globalism[^2] which has led to greater international trade and limited international cooperation. Thus, when comparing the lessons of the League of Nations to the construction of a World Government in the 21st century it is likely that the World Government would get a comparative tailwind relative to the nationalism of the 20th century that the League of Nations faced.

## The League of Nations' Lack of Adoption

## The League of Nations' Lack of Enforcement Power, and the Necessity for True Sovereignty


[^1]: This was also the point of communism's rise, which in theory was strictly internationalist, but in practice was almost always nationalistic. For example, the Soviet Union's propaganda was heavily focused on "defense of the motherland" during the Second World War - not defence of the international proletariat or the world revolution.

[^2]: This belief in globalism in foreign relations--not economics--is tempered by strong *interior* nationalist movements, such as those leading to the continuing electoral successes of strongmen like Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Donald Trump in the United States, Narendra Modi in India, and Vladimir Putin in Russia. Despite this, these are interior nationalist movements calling for preservation of national culture in the threat of imagined or real threats from "the other" - not the expansion of the nation's borders(save for Putin). This is a marked difference from the nationalism of the 20th century, which was expansionist and imperialist in nature.
