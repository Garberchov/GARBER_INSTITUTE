## Introduction: The League of Nations

The League of Nations was an international organization founded in 1919 after the Paris Peace Conference, mainly at the behest of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. The League was established primarily as a means of preventing future wars, even stating so as its first goal in its charter, "to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, by the prescription of open ... relations between nations, by the firm establishments of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments" (League of Nations n.d.). The League was, in effect, a desire to remake the Concert of Europe(Lascurettes n.d.) after crippling Germany and breaking up Austria-Hungary, a system of international relations that had focused on the maintenance of a balance of power between the major European powers. The League was to be a more modern version of this system, with the United States as a significant player and was to be a forum for resolving international disputes and a means of collective security. Despite this aspiration, the League was almost immediately defunct but took two decades to die, and its failure to police the aggressive actions of the Fascist powers in the 1930s gave way to the Second World War. For the purpose of learning from the League's failure in the context of designing a World Government, it is crucial to explore the League's lack of adoption and enforcement power.

### Note

Considering the time period of its founding and, indeed, the circumstances that precipitated the First World War, it must be noted that the age of nationalism was in full swing. Nationalism, the belief that one's nation is superior to all others due to its culture, history, and language, was the predominant political philosophy[^1] of the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. This is no longer the case, and the dominant political philosophy of the 21st century is globalism[^2], which has led to greater international trade and limited international cooperation. Thus, when comparing the lessons of the League of Nations to the construction of a World Government in the 21st century, it is likely that the World Government would get a comparative tailwind relative to the nationalism of the 20th century that the League of Nations faced.

## The League of Nations' Lack of Adoption

The value of an international organization designed to prevent war and foster cooperation between nations is directly proportional to the number of nations that are members of the organization. The League of Nations was founded in 1919, and by 1935, it had reached its peak membership of 58 member states. While that sounds impressive that the U.S.--the nation that provided the most significant supporter for the League, Woodrow Willson, and the most powerful economy in the world--did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles and thus did not join the League, it made the League near dead on arrival. More than this, nations were allowed to leave the League, and many did so when it went against their interests or criticized their actions. Japan left after being condemned for its invasion of Manchuria(Brown 1933), with no consequences, and Germany because of the refusal to allow rearmament to parity with the other European powers(Neurath n.d.). A person cannot walk out of a courthouse when being tried for a crime, saying that they do not recognize the court's authority, and then go back to doing the crime, but that is the lack of power the League had. Without the support and influence of its most potent (potential) founding member and no means of keeping its members in the organization, the League of Nations was doomed to fail.

## The League of Nations' Lack of Enforcement Power, and the Necessity for True Sovereignty

While the last section briefly touched upon the lack of enforcement capability for the League of Nations, this is a foundational structural constraint for the World Government--how much latitude do interior organizational units hold relative to the top-level World Government--so it deserves further exploration. Even in comparison to the previously explored U.N. (II.2), the power of the League to make decisions was limited. In Article 11 of the charter, the firmest statement on their opposition to conflict(and how they would oppose it) is, "Any War or threat of war ... is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations."(League of Nations n.d.). While this sounds like a strong statement against war, it prescribes no powers or actions within its scope that the League may take in case of war--it was, in effect, a bluff that it would maintain some form of power long enough that the members would later give it greater franchise. The total toothlessness of the League of Nations is evident in its charter, and even had the United States been a strong early supporter pushing for a more powerful League against the threat of actual war between the League and whatever infringing nation, it would have been unlikely to act militarily. The League of Nations was a paper tiger, incapable of managing its internal members or enforcing its own decisions; the World Government _must_, as a function of being a state, be able to do both.

This is the greatest difference in comparing the E.U. (II.1), the U.N. (II.2), or the League of Nations to the World Government of this paper. While the E.U. holds considerable sway over its member states, it is incapable of actual interior police action against a malfeasant member state, and the U.N. went from calling for(and coordinating) the defense of South Korea to tiny protests against the seizure of Crimea and follow-up full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The World Government is a state, not an organization, union, League, or alliance. It must be able to enforce its top-level(what would be called "federal" in the United States, but we have not yet defined the relationship between the World Government and its smaller organizational units) laws and decisions like any State can on its territory. The world is the territory of the World Government, and the pre-unification nations are gone, holding no sovereignty in the same way that Alberta, Bavaria, or California do not hold sovereignty in Canada, Germany, or the United States. Why is true sovereignty within its domains critical instead of the limited sovereignty of the E.U. or the U.N.? The answer is simple: the limited sovereignty of the E.U. and the U.N. cannot make the state-level sovereignty actions necessary for true governance. In the same way that Canada can force Alberta to do something, the World Government must be able to force a province/regional governmental unit to do something. This is the only way that true governance can be achieved: by elevating the power of the World Government to the same level as any other state - just with no competitors.

[^1]: This was also the point of communism's rise, which in theory was strictly internationalist but, in practice, was almost always nationalistic. For example, the Soviet Union's propaganda was heavily focused on the "defense of the motherland" during the Second World War - not the defense of the international proletariat or the world revolution.
[^2]: This belief in globalism in foreign relations--not economics--is tempered by strong _interior_ nationalist movements, such as those leading to the continuing electoral successes of strongmen like Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Donald Trump in the United States, Narendra Modi in India, and Vladimir Putin in Russia. Despite this, these are interior nationalist movements calling for the preservation of national culture in the threat of imagined or real threats from "the other" - not the expansion of the nation's borders(save for Putin). This is a marked difference from the nationalism of the 20th century, which was expansionist and imperialist.
