- IV.4: Inherent Problems to Address with the Global Nation

- IV.4.a: The Global Nation will by its nature have no outside competitor to compare itself to, and no outside force to keep it in check. How would this be handled? Are stronger institutions the answer here, or weaker ones? Is greater regional and local autonomy the answer here, or less?
- IV.4.b: Defeating Cardwell's Law, and how the Global Nation would have to be structured to prevent it.
	- IV.4.b.i: Cardwell's Law: "States can only be innovative/technically creative for a limited period of time, after which point they move about the pace of every other state"
    - IV.4.b.ii: How would the Global Nation be structured to prevent this? Is it possible to structurally prevent it.
      - IV.4.b.ii.a: Mention the United States, and how it has been able to avoid Cardwell's Law for so long.
      - IV.4.b.ii.b: Mention the United Kingdom, and how it was a victim of Cardwell's Law.
- IV.4.c: The Roman Empire fell due to its lack of external competitors to unite, drive forward, and focus its efforts. How would the Global Nation avoid this fate?
    - IV.4.c.i: Mention the Roman Empire, and how it fell due to a lack of external competitors.
    - IV.4.c.ii: Mention the United States, and how it hasn't been able to avoid this fate(in large part - it can still avoid it, but is trending inward, isolationist, and protectionist).
- IV.4.d. Is tyranny of the majority, of wealthy vs poor as the divide, going to lead to demands of indefinite, or continued, wealth redistribution?

#### Response

The pre-unification world of nation states had many problems that the disunity, factionalism, and artificial divsion of these states did not help to solve. The formation of a Global Nation in accordance with the principles, procedures, and policies outlined in this examination would not immediately make these problems go away. In fact, it is the express purpose of the Global Nation to hold sufficient safeguards to avoid using the state's monopoly on force and considerable resources to increase its power--even if only accidentally--to try to solve these problems. The Global Nation is so designed to eliminate the need for a state to solve these problems because the elimination of artificial barriers and an increase in the flow of information, resources, and talented individuals will allow for the self-organization of individuals and groups to solve these problems. These pre-existing, "humanity-wide" problems such as climate change, the obesity epidemic, and others similar in nature are not solveable by edict or dictate of the Global Nation, but by the choices and actions of individuals and groups within the Global Nation. However, there are specific problems that fundamentally effect the political structure of the Global Nation, inherent to the nature of its own structure, that must be addressed to defend the Global Nation from its own internal weaknesses.
