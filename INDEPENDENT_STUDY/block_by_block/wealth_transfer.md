### Case Study

In accordance with the economic philosophy of the world-government, the question of ensuring the rapid development of the less-developed areas of the world is a pressing one both economically and politically, as the centrifugal forces of a huge wealth disparity could threaten the stability and political legitimacy of the world government. The question of how to bring the numerically greater but significantly poorer areas of the world up to the level of the numerically smaller but significantly richer areas of the world is a complex one, especially in consideration of the long precedent that this implementation would set for the future of the world government. The economic philosophy of the world government, as explored previously, equivocally does not support or provide for a continual anti-wealth-inequality mechanism, but rather a system of strong institutions and the opening of barriers to ensure that the wealth of the world grows in totality instead of being redistributed from a fixed-sum pool. However, the question of whether a short-term "wealth drain" from the wealthy areas to the poorer areas of the world, directed in some measure by the government, to dramatically speed up development to ensure long-term stability of the world government is necessary is a pressing one. Relevant historical precedents for this are lacking, as States are generally not in the business of adding territorially those areas that are significantly poorer than themselves, but the post-World War II Marshall Plan is a notable example of a successful short-term wealth transfer from a richer area to a significantly poorer one--even if it is for reasons of war rather than poor economic development in the first place--that greatly accelerated the economic growth of Western Europe and provides for strong, lasting ties between the United States and Europe.

#### Historical Background & Caveats

George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army during World War II, and then Secretary of State under Truman, proposed the Marshall Plan in 1947 as a way to rebuild Europe following the devastation of World War II. There was widespread worry that the economic instability of Western Europe: high inflation, unemployment, and a lack of food and housing, would lead to the spread of communism. The Marshall Plan was signed into law by President Truman in 1948--really, the "Economic Cooperation Act of 1948", but forever known as The Marshall Plan--granting $5 billion in aid to 16 European countries over four years - this number would rise to $13.6 billion by 1951, approximately $190 billion in 2024 dollars. While this was a large amount of money, especially when taken as a percentage of USD GDP at the time(giving away $5 billion to start from a GDP of ~$250 billion), it was still a small amount of money compared to GDP of the recipient nations. The justifications for the Marshall Plan were wideranging from the humanitarian, the economically self-interested, and the geostrategic. The economic and geostrategic justifications principally interest this examination and Marshall himself stated them well, "Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace (National Archives)." The Marshall Plan helped to rapidly, if not instantaneously, rebuild Western Europe, but this economic blessing wasn't able to be felt in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Marshall Plan and forbade its satellite states from participating as well. Without this, and under the strain of rebuilding its own shattered lands, the Soviet Union was unable to provide the same level of economic support to its satellite states, leading to a widening economic gap between Western Europe and Eastern Europe that would lead to greater privations for the people of Eastern Europe and a yawning technological and economic gap between the two spheres of global influence.

Economic growth in Western Europe was rapid following the implementation of the Marshall Plan, though not entirely due to it--equally critical, and as a condition of receiving Marshall Plan aid, was the opening of trade barriers(part of the Bretton Woods system) and the establishment of strong institutions to ensure that the aid was used effectively. The Marshall Plan, and its accompanying second-order institutional effects, "made a decisive contribution to the renewal of the transport system, the modernization of industrial and agricultural equipment, [and] the resumption of normal production(Herman Van der Wee)." This effect, not buying the development of a whole region but sparking it with a short-term infusion of capital and long-term technological cooperation and trade, is a model that could be used to bring the less-developed areas of the world up to the level of the more developed areas of the world. However using the Marshall Plan as a direct model for this needs to be done with a few caveats, notably that the Marshall Plan was between nations, not an internal wealth transfer which is what this would be, that the Marshall Plan was a short-term wealth transfer, not something that was a continuous mechanism to ensure total economic parity, and that the Marshall Plan was a geostrategic counter to the spread of Communism(as pushed by the Soviet Union).
