### Case Study

In accordance with the economic philosophy of the world-government, the question of ensuring the rapid development of the less-developed areas of the world is a pressing one both economically and politically, as the centrifugal forces of a huge wealth disparity could threaten the stability and political legitimacy of the Global Nation. The question of how to bring the numerically greater but significantly poorer areas of the world up to the level of the numerically smaller but significantly richer areas of the world is a complex one, especially in consideration of the long precedent that this implementation would set for the future of the Global Nation. The economic philosophy of the Global Nation, as explored previously, equivocally does not support or provide for a continual anti-wealth-inequality mechanism, but rather a system of strong institutions and the opening of barriers to ensure that the wealth of the world grows in totality instead of being redistributed from a fixed-sum pool. However, the question of whether a short-term "wealth drain" from the wealthy areas to the poorer areas of the world, directed in some measure by the government, to dramatically speed up development to ensure long-term stability of the Global Nation is necessary is a pressing one. Relevant historical precedents for this are lacking, as States are generally not in the business of adding territorially those areas that are significantly poorer than themselves, but the post-World War II Marshall Plan is a notable example of a successful short-term wealth transfer from a richer area to a significantly poorer one--even if it is for reasons of war rather than poor economic development in the first place--that greatly accelerated the economic growth of Western Europe and provides for strong, lasting ties between the United States and Europe.

#### Historical Background & Caveats

George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army during World War II, and then Secretary of State under Truman, proposed the Marshall Plan in 1947 as a way to rebuild Europe following the devastation of World War II. There was widespread worry that the economic instability of Western Europe: high inflation, unemployment, and a lack of food and housing, would lead to the spread of communism. The Marshall Plan was signed into law by President Truman in 1948--really, the "Economic Cooperation Act of 1948", but forever known as The Marshall Plan--granting $5 billion in aid to 16 European countries over four years - this number would rise to $13.6 billion by 1951, approximately $190 billion in 2024 dollars. While this was a large amount of money, especially when taken as a percentage of USD GDP at the time(giving away $5 billion to start from a GDP of $274.5 billion), it was still a small amount of money compared to GDP of the recipient nations. The justifications for the Marshall Plan were wideranging from the humanitarian, the economically self-interested, and the geostrategic. The economic and geostrategic justifications principally interest this examination and Marshall himself stated them well, "Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace (National Archives)." The Marshall Plan helped to rapidly, if not instantaneously, rebuild Western Europe, but this economic blessing wasn't able to be felt in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Marshall Plan and forbade its satellite states from participating as well. Without this, and under the strain of rebuilding its own shattered lands, the Soviet Union was unable to provide the same level of economic support to its satellite states, leading to a widening economic gap between Western Europe and Eastern Europe that would lead to greater privations for the people of Eastern Europe and a yawning technological and economic gap between the two spheres of global influence.

Economic growth in Western Europe was rapid following the implementation of the Marshall Plan, though not entirely due to it--equally critical, and as a condition of receiving Marshall Plan aid, was the opening of trade barriers(part of the Bretton Woods system) and the establishment of strong institutions to ensure that the aid was used effectively. The Marshall Plan, and its accompanying second-order institutional effects, "made a decisive contribution to the renewal of the transport system, the modernization of industrial and agricultural equipment, [and] the resumption of normal production(Herman Van der Wee)." This effect, not buying the development of a whole region but sparking it with a short-term infusion of capital and long-term technological cooperation and trade, is a model that could be used to bring the less-developed areas of the world up to the level of the more developed areas of the world. However using the Marshall Plan as a direct model for this needs to be done with a few caveats, notably that the Marshall Plan was between nations, not an internal wealth transfer which is what this would be; that the Marshall Plan was a short-term wealth transfer, not something that was a continuous mechanism to ensure total economic parity, and that the Marshall Plan was a geostrategic counter to the spread of Communism(as pushed by the Soviet Union).

All of these caveats are interconnected as a function of it being an inter-state wealth transfer, it was never in question that the United States would keep doing it forever. The issue of precedents is critical here though, as the United States was clearly not endowing itself with the responsibility to ensure the continued economic growth of Western Europe, but rather primarily to ensure that Western Europe did not fall to Communism. The Global Nation, however, if it did not explicitly state that it was a one-time event, would be setting a precedent for continual wealth transfers from the richer areas to the poorer areas of the world forever, becoming a political football and a source of contention between any two areas of the world. It is not difficult to imagine a follow-up where a wealthy area of the world with low economic growth rates demands a wealth transfer from another wealthy area of the world with higher economic growth to stimulate it, or from the Global Nation at large, entirely divorcing the original intent and casting the economic philosophy of the World Government aside. It must be fundamentally established that this is a one-time event, and that the Global Nation will not be in the business of redistributing wealth from the richer areas to the poorer areas of the world, that this is purely for the sake of jump-starting the economic growth of the less-developed areas of the world to ensure the long-term stability of the Global Nation and the whole world's prosperity as a result.

#### The Second Marshall Plan

With those caveats and modifications to the mechanism of the Marshall Plan in mind, it is possible to outline a "Second Marshall Plan" for the wealthier nations of the world to make a one-time endowed transfer of wealth to the less-wealthy areas of the world to kickstart their developmnent. It is critical to state that the direct infusion of capital will be less important than the establishment of strong institutions and the opening of trade barriers, but these go hand-in-hand to stimulate local entrepreneurship and let that growth connect with local and global markets without the crippling weight of corruption and tarriffs. While it may appear to be putting the cart before the horse to say that strong instituions and the opening of trade barriers are more important than the direct infusion of capital, corruption by itself(tarriffs will be discussed in a later section) is a significant drag on economic growth and development, with Africa providing a clear case of this, "Africa loses $128 billion a year to corruption, equivalent to 50% of its tax revenues and 25% of its GDP. ... These figures make it clear that corruption remains a major challenge to sustainable economic growth, good governance, peace and stability, which are requirements for tangible economic development in Africa. (Njangang, Asongu, Mouchili)." However with the establishment of strong anti-corruption, pro-growth institutions, the opening of trade barriers, and the infusion of capital either directly or through second-order effects like the building of infrastructure, the less-developed areas of the world(Africa, South America, South Asia) could be brought up to the level of developed areas of the world(North America, Europe, Oceania) rapidly and in doing so ensure the long-term stability of the Global Nation and accelerate the growth of the world's prosperity as a whole.

Upon that justification, the question naturally arises of what form this "Second Marshall Plan" would take, how it would be implemented, and how much it would cost. An exact figure nor a precise plan is possible to predict ahead of time, as it would likely be a matter of cosniderable political wrangling in the convincing of many nations to join the Global Nation, but based on the Marshall Plan it would be possible to make a fair estimate. As previously stated, the Marshall Plan gave approximately $13.6 billion in aid to 16 European countries over four years, and when taken as a percentage of US GDP in 1948 when the program began($274.5 Billion), it represented just under 5% of one year's GDP. While it was a tremendous amount of money, for the benefit it gave both parties it was a great deal, and a similar percentage infusion of capital from the developed areas of the world could have similar effects. The wealthy areas of the world[^1], under their reorganized nature in the Global Nation, with a yearly GDP(in their current form of nation states) of $57,470,602 million in 2022, or $57.4 trillion, to the world's 47 least developed countries(Annex A, OECD)[^2], reorganized as part of the Global Nation, splitting on a case-by-case basis where the money would be most effective in accelerating economic development and raising the standard of living of the people of that area. At the 5% of GDP rate, this would be 2.87 trillion dollars, and spreading that over five years would decrease the yearly cost to the wealthy areas of the world to $574 billion among them. This is a significant amount of money, but the first, second, and third-order effects of this would be a tremendous boon to the world as a whole, and would go far to ensure the long-term stability of the Global Nation as well as the raising of all areas to the level of the most developed areas of the world, and then beyond.

[^1]: Based on the International Monetary Fund's list of "Advanced Economies", the measure I find most convincing for wealthy nations in categorization compared to the UN's HDI-based list. The list and their gdp is as follows(in millions of US dollars) as of 2022: Andorra(3,352), Australia(1,675,419), Austria(471,400), Belgium(578,604), Canada(2,139,840), Cyprus(28,439), Czech Republic(290,924), Denmark(395,404), Estonia(38,101), Finland(280,826), France(2,782,905), Germany(4,072,192), Greece(219,066), Hong Kong SAR(359,839), Iceland(27,842), Ireland(529,245), Israel(522,033), Italy(2,010,432), Japan(4,231,141), Korea, Rep(1,665,246), Lithuania(70,970), Latvia(41,154), Luxembourg(82,275), Macao SAR(21,979), Malta(17,765), Netherlands(991,115), New Zealand(247,234), Norway(579,267), Portugal(251,945), Puerto Rico(113,435), San Marino(1,855), Singapore(466,789), Slovak Republic(115,469), Slovenia(62,118), Spain(1,397,509), Sweden(585,939), Switzerland(807,706), Taiwan Province of China(760,460 - from Aaron O'Niell, Statistsa), United Kingdom(3,070,668), United States(25,462,700).
[^2]: There are many middle-income countries between the least developed countries and the most developed countries, but the instutional benefits of the Global Nation as well as the elimination of trade barriers would make the relatively small amount of money that would go to a widening pool of countries less valuable, especially as the middle-income nations have higher labor costs. The least developed countries are the most in need of a jumpstart to their economic development, the middle-income countries will accelerate by themselves without it and would only water-down the effects of the wealth transfer to those areas that need it most critically.
