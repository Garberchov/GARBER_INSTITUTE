- IV.3: Structures for Citizen Participation/Government Structure.
- IV.3.a: How would the Global Nation be structured to allow for citizen participation in government? Would it be a direct democracy, a representative democracy, or something else entirely?

  - IV.3.a.i: Tie back to Switzerland, and their implementation of direct democracy.
  - IV.3.a.ii: The United States as a general example of a representative democracy, mention Plato's "Republic"(when talking about executive), and the Parliament of France(call back to previous references to France)
  - IV.3.a.iii: "Architecture of a Technodemocracy" by Jason M. Hanania, and how certain elements of techodemocracy would be a good fit for the Global Nation.
  - IV.3.a.iv: The structure of citizen participation in the Global Nation as a triad of direct democracy, representative democracy, and technodemocracy(not technocracy) into a cohesive form, and how it interacts with a system of objectively scalable government.

#### Response

Throughout history, the citizenry of a state has held varying degrees of influence over the actions, policies, and decisions of their state(in so much as it was 'their' state at all). As a pre-condition of this examination, the Global Nation must be structured in such a way that it could be correctly considered a "Democracy", and the previous sections have laid out the groundwork for this both morally, as it relates to the Liberal foundation of the Global Nation, and systemically, as the organizational structure of the Global Nation includes a system of government that takes in the direct will of the people. This still leaves a wide range of possibilities for what such a system of citizen participation could look like, and as no "optimal" systems exists, a series of trade-offs must be made in order to create a system that fits the unqiue constraints and goals of the Global Nation. A wide range of systems are available for consideration, but in seeking the fine principles to combine into a cohesive whole, brief examinations of the direct democracy of Switzerland(previously mentioned in [II.1.a.]), the representative democracy of the United States, the philosophical executive of Plato's _Republic_, the Parliament of France, and the technodemocracy of Jason M. Hanania's _Architecture of a Technodemocracy_ will be made, and useful principles co-opted, combined, and re-imagined for the Global Nation.

Beginning with the United States, several intermediary layers exist between the direct will[^1] of the constituents of the United States and the actions of the government of the United States, both at the highest federal level and in lower levels of government. This is the fundamental reasons for being of a system of Representative Democracy, and holds considerable advantages in terms of scalability, efficiency, and the ability to handle a wide range of issues. This is seem functionally in the design of a bicameral legislature, with the House of Representatives representing the direct will of the people, and the Senate representing the will of the states who were originally

[^1]: When talking about the will of the public in this context, it is referring to the many individual thoughts, opinions, and desires of the citizenry, and not a "general will" as described by Rousseau.
