#### Response

Throughout history, the citizenry of a state has held varying degrees of influence over the actions, policies, and decisions of their state(in so much as it was 'their' state at all). As a pre-condition of this examination, the Global Nation must be structured in such a way that it could be correctly considered a "Democracy", and the previous sections have laid out the groundwork for this both morally, as it relates to the Liberal foundation of the Global Nation, and systemically, as the organizational structure of the Global Nation includes a system of government that takes in the direct will of the people. This still leaves a wide range of possibilities for what such a system of citizen participation could look like, and as no "optimal" systems exists, a series of trade-offs must be made in order to create a system that fits the unqiue constraints and goals of the Global Nation. A wide range of systems are available for consideration, but in seeking the fine principles to combine into a cohesive whole, brief examinations of the direct democracy of Switzerland(previously mentioned in [II.1.a.]), the representative democracy of the United States, and the technodemocracy of Jason M. Hanania's _Architecture of a Technodemocracy_ will be made, and useful principles co-opted, combined, and re-imagined for the Global Nation.

Switzerland, as mentioend in [II.1.a.]: "Why is Switzerland in the Schengen Area but not the EU itself?", is a direct democracy--a unqiue fixture in the world of modern states--with two primary mechanisms for direct citizen participation: the referendum and the initiative. The referendum is a vote on a law that has been passed by the Swiss parliament, and the initiative is a vote on a law that has been proposed by the Swiss people. Both of these allow the will of the people[^1], in separate ways, to hold large sway in the rules of the state that holds legitimacy as a result of their grace. What makes these mechanisms astounding, and useful for the Global Nation, is that these same mechanisms have been in place since the middle of the 19th century, where infrastructure for intellectual, political, and cultural connectivity was far more primitive than it is in even the least developed regions today. That Switzerland has prospered under this system, and did so even before the advent of modern communication technology, is a direct contradiction to the popular conception of any form of direct democracy too cumbersone or feeble to be effective. More than this, the Swiss system of direct democracy also includes a legislative branch of elected representatives, who also hold the power to draft laws and pass them to the consideration of the people. Despite this, the Swiss system of professional political representation is unmistakably different from that of the United States or France, "The National Council and the Council of States meet separately for three-week sessions four times a year. The two chambers debate all constitutional amendments before putting them to the popular vote. They also adopt, amend or repeal federal legislation(About Switzerland)", but this frequency is less symptomatic of the Swiss system as a whole and more wholly representative of Swiss political culture. This form of hybrid direct and representative democracy(referred to henceforth as simply "hybrid democracy") is an invaluable model for the Global Nation, as it allows for the direct consultation of the people, their direct input and suggestion into the laws that govern them, a veto over laws which may prioritize the interests of the government over its people, and a system of elected representatives who can use their experience and character to act as the people's delegate in the day-to-day functioning of the state.

<!-- in specific refutation of the idea that the people are too stupid to govern themselves, two rebuttals become clear: one, then the state is not doing a sufficient job in allowing the people to educate themselves, or providing enough information on issues confronting the state for them to be accurately informed; two, what is the alternative? monarchies, where random chance of blood is the right of rulership, or military juntas? a philosopher king isn't possible, as established in relation to Plato. -->

The United States, partly as a function of its federalism but also as an intentional choice of its framers, is a representative democracy with a number of intermediaries between the direct will of the people and the decisions that affect them. In many ways, this is a useful function of a highly compartmentalized representative model, as different branches and levels of government can be structured as checks on each other to avoid the concentration of power in any one place, and to incentive cooperation between different groups of people to achieve political aims of mutual interest. While not referring to the United States specifically, Alonso, Keane, and Merkel bring this point to the fore, "Representative government was also hailed as an effective new method of apportioning blame for poor political performance; a new way of encouraging the rotation of leadership, guided by merit. Right from the beginning, some critics thought of it as a form of elected aristocracy, but that rather understated another claimed advantage of representative democracy: that it cleared space for political minorities and competition for power that in turn enabled elected representatives to test out their political competence in the presence of others (Alonso, Keane, and Merkel)." These are significant virtues of the representative model, and these become even more important when considering the huge area and population of the Global Nation. The system is not without its flaws--both in the United States, and as a general model--as the actions of the representatives are necessarily disconnected from those who empowered them, and the constituents of a repesentative are not entirely homogenous of opinion. While the models of Switzerland and the United States both include representative elements, in this view the United States' model falls prey to the criticisms of representative democracy more strongly, "It frustrates collective action by splintering the _demos_ [populace] and by disconnecting the exercise of power from its rightful source; an active _demos_ [populace] is replaced by political professionals who protect powerful particular interests. Representation makes a mockery of the power-principle of democracy, majority rule: ‘majorities are artifacts manufactured by money, organization and the media’ (Alonso, Keane, and Merkel)." This underscores, albeit slightly exaggerates, the importance of direct mechanisms of citizen participation in the Global Nation, especially considering the total political scale of the Global Nation.

Technodemocracy, as described by Jason M. Hanania in _Architecture of a Technodemocracy_[^2], is a system of government that uses technology to allow for the direct participation of the citizenry in the day-to-day functioning of the state, keeps the state accountable, and allows for the state to be more directly responsible for acting contrary to the interests of the voters. The foundational tenets of it are rapid peer-to-peer communication, electronic(internet/blockchain) voting on day-to-day and long-term issues, and the power of the people to recall their representatives at any time. As Hanania describes it, "each group member would have communication power, option power, decision power, and accountability power, equal to that of any other group member, including representatives. The representatives would simply carry out the decisions of the group (Hanania)." This is a powerful model for the Global Nation, as it allows for the day-to-day management to be off-loaded to representatives as long as they act rigteously in service of their constituents, with an immediate and continual check on their power. The structure of Hanania's technodemocratic model is far more extensive than this, but functionally the keys are explained in this example.

#### Footnotes

[^1]: When talking about the will of the public in this context, it is referring to the many individual thoughts, opinions, and desires of the citizenry, and not a "general will" as described by Rousseau. A "general will" allows for conceptions of "the greater good" or "the common interest" to be used as a justification for the imposition of the will of the state on the individual, coercion, and this is expressly against what the Global Nation stands for, and what "the will of the people" is meant to represent in this context.
[^2]: Hanania's book includes valuable insights into the implementation of technodemocratic principles into governance, but also includes some ideas that are entirely contrary to the principles of the Global Nation, most notably including the nationalization of the tech industry. His useful ideas are not less useful as a result of this, but this examination does not endorse--or utilize the ideas of--his book in its entirety.
