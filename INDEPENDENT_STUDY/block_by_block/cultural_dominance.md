### Preventing Mono-Cultural Dominance

#### From The Outline:

```markdown
V.1: How does the political structure of the Global Nation prevent the dominance of a single culture, or the dominance of political entity on the lines of cultural identity, while still allowing for free expression? - V.1.a: This question comes into play especially in the case of ethic or cultural groups starting to form political parties or entities for the sole benefit of their own group, instead of a party on ideological lines. Should this be prevented? If not, how would it be prevented from doing harm to the stability and freedom of the Global Nation while not infringing on the freedoms of the group?
```

#### Response:

<!-- Any law put in place to prevent cultural dominance via government regulation, anti-ANYTHING, will be perverted in support of the dominance of a majority or minority. The government is non-interventionist here. It is strictly EQUAL. -->
<!-- It is the antipathy of explorations in the field of political science to offer no solution where one could be imagined, and given reality through the force of government but.. -->

The awe-inspiring scale of the Global Nation, in encompassing the whole world and all of its people, is threatened by the potential for political entities to form along cultural lines, and a form of mono-cultural dominance through political means established. In pre-unification states, political parties founded for the specific advancement of a single enthnicity, religion, geographic region, or other cultural identity formented artificial divisions outside of political ideology, but through the false pretense of an "us vs. them" mentality. These parties, and other spontaneous social movements like them, have exemplified and magnified some of the worst humanity is capable of throughout history, from genocide, civil war, the suppression of human rights, and the definite political and economic distinction between people based on their cultural identity. However, equally contrary to the principles of freedom, individual liberty and responsibility, and the right of self-determination, is the idea of government using its power to prevent the formation of these spontaneous social orders, which in itself would be the exact kind of tyranny this measure would be meant to prevent. Fundamentally, this problem offers a fundamental question for the nature of the Global Nation, the greatest conceivable multicultural society: what is multiculturalism in the Global Nation, how is it different from the multiculturalism of the pre-unification world, and how is social dominance by a single culture--whatever that culture may be--prevented, if at all?

As explored in the Economic Philosophy of the Global Nation [III.1], the Global Nation adheres to a strongly Liberal[^1] economic philosophy, which foundationally asserts strong individual rights in the political sphere more generally. As Irene Bloemraad defined it, "Under classical liberalism, all people must be treated the same, and governments should remain blind to particularities of ethnicity, religion, or national origin. They should not, for example, provide public funding for cultural minority groups. Such a stance has long been associated with the French Republican approach to diversity" which is countered by the modern multiculturalist approach, which "argues that cultural neutrality in public institutions is impossible. Since democracy is based on government by the majority, minorities face disadvantages in the public sphere despite laws guaranteeing certain rights and freedoms (Bloemraad, Irene)." The Global Nation, structurally designed to counter Tyranny of the Majority [IV.4], does reasonably defend against this to some degree. More strongly, the idea of a government that must treat people differently in order to make them equal, as Hayek asserted, is fundamentally flawed. The Global Nation, to maintain internal stability through its continence as a non-arbiter of culture, a self-organizing phenomenon impossible to dictate, must not accept differing treatment between any two individuals _by the government_ based on any arbitrary factor, but must instead practice--and preach--the idea of total equality under the law.

#### Footnotes:

[^1]: Capitalized to distinguish from the modern, mostly American but more generally Western, political ideology of being "liberal", i.e. progressive, left-leaning, or however else it is defined in the context of the modern political spectrum. Liberal in this context refers to classical Liberalism, the political philosophy of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government espoused by the likes of John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, and later taken up by the Austrian School of Economics, among others.
