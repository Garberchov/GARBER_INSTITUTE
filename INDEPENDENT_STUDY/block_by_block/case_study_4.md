## III.1: What is the economic philosophy of the world government? 

Discussions of government economic philosophy are some of the most contentious and divisive in both academia and society at large. While the term "government economic philosophy" is broad and can encompass a wide range of topics, the definition most useful for this examination is the government's role in the economy - specifically, how much intervention the government has in the economy. This is a spectrum, with the polar opposites freqeuntly but not always being correlated with political ideologies. What governmental structure the World Government has is a question addressed elsewhere in this paper, so this corollary does not take effect in this instance. At one far end of the spectrum is anarcho-capitalism, where the government plays no role in the economy save for the purchase of goods to facilitate its own existence, largely to enforce contracts and protect property rights. At the other far end of the spectrum is a command economy, where the government controls all aspects of the economy, from production to distribution to consumption. While this is sometimes called "communism" this is not accurate, as communism is a political ideology with an economy backbone, based on the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state. Thus, the term "command economy" for states like the Soviet Union, Maoist China, and North Korea is more accurate. In the middle of this spectrum is the descriptively named "mixed economy", where the government plays a role in the economy, but the majority of economic activity is left to the private sector--specifically, with private entities owning the means of production and acting in their own self-interest. The government's role in a mixed economy is to regulate the private sector to remove monopolies, ensure fair competition[^1], and provide public goods and services that the private sector cannot or will not provide. 

Three different "groups" of economic philosophy, and some associated comparisons among nations that have adopted these philosophies, are discussed in the following sections. Approximately mid-way between the mixed economy and anarcho-capitalism we find the first group, that of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. It is important to note that while Hayek and Friedman are often put together, they are not identical in their beliefs, however they incorporate enough range while maintaining a similar core that they can be grouped together for the purposes of this examination. The second group, just on the command economy side of the mixed-economy midpoint, is that of John Maynard Keynes and William Beveridge. It is important to note that Beveridge was far less original in his proposed economic planning than Keynes, but was instrumental in providing the political steps to such an implementation as the Welfare State in the United Kingdom. Finally, the third group, found near the command economy end of the spectrum, is that of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. They were the originators of communist theory, and while that is NOT the same as a command economy, their theories on worker ownership of the means of production in favor of common ownership is the basis for the command economy[^2]. With our three groups established, we will then compare some nations employing these philosophies, and the results of their economic policies: East and West Germany, South and North Korea, and the United States and Denmark.

### III.1.a.a: Hayek & Friedman

#### III.1.a.a.i: Similarities and differences in their beliefs.

Before noting the similarities in what they recommended for government economic policy, it is first important to note the differences in their beliefs - while they were fundamentally similar in many ways, they were not of one mind nor one "school"[^3]. The two great differences between the two, making their processes for reaching similar *policy* conclusions far different, are their views on monetary policy and methodology. Hayek, as a member of the Austrian school of economics, based his economic precepts on theoretical and philosophical grounds, while Friedman, as a member of the Chicago school of economics, was an empiricist in his methods in much the same way as Keynes[^4]. When Hayek was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1974, he made this stark methodological difference clear in his acceptance speech, "The Pretense of Knowledge", in a pithy remark, "The correlation between aggregate demand and total employment, for instance, may only be approximate, but as it is the *only* one on which we have quantitative data, it is accepted as the only causal connection that counts. On this standard there may thus well exist better 'scientific' evidence for a false theory, which will be accepted because it is more 'scientific', than for a valid explanation, which is rejected because there is no sufficient quantitative evidence for it."(Hayek, F). In this way, Hayek was a strong critic of the empirical methods of Keynes(and as a result, Friedman), and instead used a priori reasoning - technically less "scientific" than empirical methods, but based on humanistic logic and deduction. 

The most practicable difference between the two was their views on monetary policy. Friedman was the founder of monetarism, the belief that gradual adjustments in the money supply could stabilize economic activity under pressure of inflation, deflation, or recession. He was a supporter of an non-gold standard fiat currency, that money has value because as a society it is endowed as a store and medium of exchange. He supported this belief with a remark in his book, *Free to Choose*, "After World War II cigarettes were widely used as money in Germany during the period when the occupation authorities enforced ceilings on prices in legal currency that were well below the levels that would have cleared the market. The rsult was to destroy the usefulness of the legal money... Ludwig Erhard's monetary refrom ended that instructive--and destructive--episode."(Friedman, M. p. 252). Hayek, on the other hand, desired a strong, stable, and non-inflationary currency and saw the gold standard as the poster child for such a currency. He was very much of the Austrian School of Economics canon in this regard, seeing money as "an institution which originates not in a decision by an individual or a group of people but as a spontaneous order arising out of countless uncoordinated efforts to overcome the problems and innefficiencies inherent in bartering.(Ravier, A). He was not advocating for a total return to the gold standard, as has been falsely claimed, but rather a return to a currency that was not subject to the whims of a central bank. In his book, *The Denationalization of Money*, he wrote, "The main result at this stage is that the chief blemish of the market order which has been the cause of well-justified reproaches, its susceptibility to recurrent periods of depression and unemployment, is a consequence of the age-old government monopoly of the issue of money. I have now no doubt whatever that private enterprise, if it had not been prevented by government, could and would long ago have provided the public with a choice of currencies, and those that prevailed in the competition would have been essentially stable in value and would have prevented both excessive stimulation of investment and the consequent periods of contraction."(Hayek, F. ). While there is a well-justified critique here that technically nothing prevents private enterprises from doing this, Hayek's grander point was that stability in the money supply was a necessary component of a free market economy, and a free society. Both Hayek and Friedman used their divergent beliefs on monetary policy as support for their protection and grounding of a free society, holding to the principles of liberty and freedom.

With these differences established--which may seem an uncrossable chasm--it is important to discuss the similarties in belief between these two men. First and foremost, both were strong advocates of the free market both in how it served for the most efficient allocation of resources and as a fundamentally necessary component of a free society. Hayek, in his most famous work, *The Road to Serfdom*, wrote, Wherever the barriiers to the free exercise of human ingenuity were removed, man became rapidly able to satisfty ever-widening ranges of desire. ... To appreciate what it meant to those who took part in it, we must measure it by the hopes and wishes men held when it began... that by the beginning of the twentieth century the working-man in the Western world had reached a degree of material comfort, security, and personal independence which a hundred years before had seemed scarcely possible. ... With the success grew ambition--and man had every right to be ambitious."(Hayek, F.). Friedman, in his book *Free to Choose*, references Adam Smith in how the free market helps to positively impact the wealth of all members of society, "In the past century am yth has grown up that free market capitalism--equality of opportunity as we have interpreted that term--increases such inequalities [of wealth, income, and opportunity], that it is a system under which the rich exploit the poor. Nothing could be further from the truth. Wherever the free market has been permitted to operate, wherever anything approaching equality of opportunity has existed, the ordinary man has been able to attain levels of living never dreamed of before."(Friedman, M). These are strikingly similar sentiments in regards the positive effects of the free market on society, and the bastion of a free society that the free market is. 

More important than their sentimental similarity, however, is their policy similarity. Both were strong advocates of the free market[^5] and both were strong critics of the Keynesian economic policies that were the dominant economic policies of the time[^6]. Both believed that in trying to ensure full employment, and thus equality of outcome, the government was not only overstepping its moral bounds, but was also misallocating resources and stifling the growth of human wealth and prosperity. To properly define this alignment, we have to discuss the personal alignment of both men: both were liberals in the classical sense. As Hayek says in *The Road to Serfdom* in a well-articulated explanation of the tenets of liberalism, "There is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a stationary creed; there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and for all. The fundamental principle that in the ordering of our affairs we should make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of society, and resort as little as possible to coercion, is capable of an infinite variety of applications. There is, in particular, all the difference between deliberately creating a system within which competition will work as beneficially as possible and passively accepting institutions as they are."

[^1]: While anti-monopoly efforts are frequently painted as contrary to a classically liberal view of the economy, this is not the case. The goal of anti-monopoly efforts is to remove the existence of states-within-states, monopolistic entities which regulate the market within the market, and thus are contrary to the free market. Large corporations are not inherently monopolistic, vertically-integrated corporations are not inherently monopolistic, but those that use their power to not only prevent competition but to prevent the market from functioning are. Those that act as command economies within the market are the target of anti-monopoly efforts. This is not a contradiction to the free market, but a necessary component of it.

[^2]: While in a command economy the state is the sole owner of the means of production, everyone is a member of the state, and thus theoretically everyone has an equal share in the means of production. This is not the case in practice, but it is the theory. As George Orwell wrote in Animal Farm, "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."

[^3]: Hayek is firmly classified as a member of the Austrian school of economics, alongside Mises and Menger, while Friedman was a member of the Chicago school of economics. While these schools are similar in many ways, specifically in their opposition to Keynesian economics and defense of the market system as the most efficient allocator of resources, they are not identical. 

[^4]: Roger W. Garrison in his excellent comparative analysis of Hayek and Friedman, "Hayek and Friedman: Head to Head", quotes Friedman as saying in his book, *Dollars and Deficits*, "'In one sense, we are all Keynesians now; in another, nobody is a Keynesian any longer.' He went on to identify the two senses: 'We all use the Keynesian language and apparatus; none of us any longer accepts the initial Keynesian conclusions.'". This "all" **does not** include the Austrian school of economics, which used a priori("from what is before": reasoning based on logic and deduction, indepedent of experience) reasoning to reach economic conclusions. 

[^5]: Which as we have previously established, **does** include anti-monopoly efforts, see footnote 1.

[^6]: Their time was certainly different, but in this context it was the mid-20th century generally.
