## III.1: What is the economic philosophy of the world government? 

Discussions of government economic philosophy are some of the most contentious and divisive in both academia and society at large. While the term "government economic philosophy" is broad and can encompass a wide range of topics, the definition most useful for this examination is the government's role in the economy - specifically, how much intervention the government has in the economy. This is a spectrum, with the polar opposites freqeuntly but not always being correlated with political ideologies. What governmental structure the World Government has is a question addressed elsewhere in this paper, so this corollary does not take effect in this instance. At one far end of the spectrum is anarcho-capitalism, where the government plays no role in the economy save for the purchase of goods to facilitate its own existence, largely to enforce contracts and protect property rights. At the other far end of the spectrum is a command economy, where the government controls all aspects of the economy, from production to distribution to consumption. While this is sometimes called "communism" this is not accurate, as communism is a political ideology with an economy backbone, based on the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state. Thus, the term "command economy" for states like the Soviet Union, Maoist China, and North Korea is more accurate. In the middle of this spectrum is the descriptively named "mixed economy", where the government plays a role in the economy, but the majority of economic activity is left to the private sector--specifically, with private entities owning the means of production and acting in their own self-interest. The government's role in a mixed economy is to regulate the private sector to remove monopolies, ensure fair competition[^1], and provide public goods and services that the private sector cannot or will not provide. 

Three different "groups" of economic philosophy, and some associated comparisons among nations that have adopted these philosophies, are discussed in the following sections. Approximately mid-way between the mixed economy and anarcho-capitalism we find the first group, that of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. It is important to note that while Hayek and Friedman are often put together, they are not identical in their beliefs, however they incorporate enough range while maintaining a similar core that they can be grouped together for the purposes of this examination. The second group, just on the command economy side of the mixed-economy midpoint, is that of John Maynard Keynes and John Rawls. It is important to note that Rawls was not an economist, but a political philosopher, but is included in this section because his work is often used to justify Keynesian economic policy. Finally, the third group, found near the command economy end of the spectrum, is that of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. They were the originators of communist theory, and while that is NOT the same as a command economy, their theories on worker ownership of the means of production in favor of common ownership is the basis for the command economy[^2]. With our three groups established, we will then compare some nations employing these philosophies, and the results of their economic policies: East and West Germany, South and North Korea, and the United States and Denmark.

[^1]: While anti-monopoly efforts are frequently painted as contrary to a classically liberal view of the economy, this is not the case. The goal of anti-monopoly efforts is to remove the existence of states-within-states, monopolistic entities which regulate the market within the market, and thus are contrary to the free market. Large corporations are not inherently monopolistic, vertically-integrated corporations are not inherently monopolistic, but those that use their power to not only prevent competition but to prevent the market from functioning are. Those that act as command economies within the market are the target of anti-monopoly efforts. This is not a contradiction to the free market, but a necessary component of it.

[^2]: While in a command economy the state is the sole owner of the means of production, everyone is a member of the state, and thus theoretically everyone has an equal share in the means of production. This is not the case in practice, but it is the theory. As George Orwell wrote in Animal Farm, "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."
