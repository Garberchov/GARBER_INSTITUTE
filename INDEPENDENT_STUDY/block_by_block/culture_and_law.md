### Culture and Law: Differing cultural customs and the law of the Global Nation

#### From Outline:

```markdown
V.2. How would cultural checks and balances be made to allow for free expression of individuals, whilst preventing what might be seen as gross oppression in one culture and normal in another.

- V.2.a: This becomes a question of whether the Global Nation has a cultural relativist or universalist philosophical view, and if so, how is it enforced.
  - V.2.a.i: For example, there is a belief from some Western Points of View that the Hijab that Muslim woman must wear is an affront to the self-determination and self-expression of that woman. How would the Global Nation handle this?
  - V.2.a.i: In another example, should a certain age be mandated to wait until before you can accept a specifically religious or cultural practice? For example, should a child in the Christian faith be able to be baptized before they have a certain number of years of life experience? If they aren't declared old enough to vote as they do not have sufficient cognitive ability to make that decision, why should they be able to join a religion? Does that not infringe on their fundamental rights of self-expression and self-determination[I.1.d]?

#### Response:

Discussions of the intersection of cultural differences and the law are fraught with difficulty, potential for misunderstanding, and viewpoints that are often in direct opposition to one another without a pathway for clear resolution. The Global Nation, as a multicultural society, must be prepared to handle these issues with a deft hand and a precise understanding of the principles that underlie its existence, and its citizens relations to it. Functionally, there is no way to please everyone, especially when it comes to deeply held beliefs and cultural practices that directly contradict one another--wars have been fought over this issue for the whole of the history of human civilization. Despite this impressive hurdle, the Global Nation must be willing to undergoe the hardship of setting a new standard for justice and fairness in both tolerance and legal righteousness.
