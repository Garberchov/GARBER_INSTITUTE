## Introduction: The United Nations
The United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945 after the Second World War by 51 countries(those who had declared war on Germany and Japan, as well as Poland, which hadn't assembled a full government yet, the Byelorussian and Ukranian Soviet Socialist Republics, Denmark, and Argentina) committed to "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom."(See "UN CHARTER" in bibliography). There was hope among many, from Einstein(see "American Museum of Natural History: Einstein's Deeply Held Political Beliefs") to Gandhi(see "Gandhi and World Peace: A Federation of the World by Dr.Klaus Schlictmann" in bibliography) to Truman[^1](see "Ensuring World Peace in the Nuclear Age by Kenneth W. Dam" in bibliography), that the UN would be empowered to create a world-wide federal state[^2]. These hopes were dashed almost instantly by the Cold War, and the UN has since been relegated to a largely symbolic role, with the Security Council - the supposed "world police" - being unable to act in many cases due to the veto power of its permanent members(the Russian invasion of Ukraine being a recent example). 

This case study will examine why the UN isn't a world government, and whether it could be the foundation of one for the purposes of this project. In it, an examination of the UN's most agressive activism, the United Nations fighting under a single flag - the flag of the United Nations itself - in the Korean War, and its decline in power, influence, and relevance since then. The hope that underscored the fantastic jubilation of the UN's founding(see '2500 Journalists: San Francisco Conference' in bibliography) that resulted from a collaboration between the widest array of nations to create something more powerful than themselves by their efforts - Vyacheslav Molotov, Anthony Eden, and Edward Stettinus all chaired the San Francisco Conference that created the UN - has been replaced by a cynical view of the UN as a powerless, irrelevant, and corrupt organization. The world government that I am proposing must capture those same idealistic aims that the UN was founded upon, but most also act with justice, decisiveness, and power over the populations it encompasses.

[^1]: While not explicit endorsement of the relief of American soverignty in favor of a world government, Truman's statement that "When Kansas and Colorado have a quarrel over the water in the Arkansas River, they don't call out the National Guard in each state and go to war over it. They bring a suit in the Supreme Court of the United States and abide by the decision." is a clear endorsement of a far more powerful international court and justice system than the UN had at its peak, nevermind today's shambles.
[^2]: Einstein, Gandhi, and Truman all had very different ideas as to what this world government would look like, and Truman wasn't fully endorsing the idea, but all three agreed that the UN was too weak to be effective but that *some* form of strong international arbiter or federal world government was necessary.
