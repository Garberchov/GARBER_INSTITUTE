- IV.2.a: Would the Global Nation be federalist, unitary, or something else?

  - IV.2.a.i: Reference the United States, and how it follows the federalist model.
  - IV.2.a.ii: Reference France(find paper I wrote on France vs Israel Government Structure), and how it follows the unitary model.
  - IV.2.a.iii: The combination structure of some elements of federalism for innovations in government structure & function that can be tried on a smaller scale, some elements of unitary government for efficiency and standardization, and some elements of direct control/direct democracy for citizen buy-in and decision making.
  - IV.2.a.iv: Include mention of what bounds lower levels of government would be structured upon in this new system - what would be their function, what would be their powers, how much latitude would they have in their decision making processes - must include relative to citizen participation in government, which hasn't been discussed yet.

Operational structures of government reflect the values, beliefs, priorities, and attitudes of the people they serve at the time of their creation. The Global Nation is no different, but holds a unique position in that it is a new nation, created from the voluntary unification of separate nations, and holding a diverse population--the whole of humanity--with a wide range of beliefs, values, and priorities. In reference to the fundamental question of how the Global Nation would be structured, and in deference to the preconditions of this examination which ensure that the Global Nation be democratic[^1] not autocratic or monarchic, the systemic form of this government would have to be federal, unitary, or some combination of the two--all other options fall outside this scope, or outside of the scope of practicality[^2]. To disambiguate, this is not a question of the structures of how citizens participate in the government of the Global Nation nor how much day-to-day control they have over the government compared to elected representatives, but rather how the government is structured and how it is organized for its operations.

To further define the terms in question here, Federalism is defined in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy as "sovereignty in federal political orders is non-centralized, often constitutionally, between at least two levels so that units at each level have final authority and can be self governing in some issue area. Citizens thus have political obligations to, or have their rights secured by, two authorities. (Follesdal, Andreas)", and can be specifically useful to "accommodate differences among populations divided by ethnic or cultural cleavages yet seeking a common, often democratic, political order (Follesdal, Andreas)". This is to be contrasted with its opposite--in this very specific context, though not in general political science--the unitary model, which is defined as "a governing system in which a single central government has total power over all of its other political subdivisions (Longley, Robert)". In the current world of nation-states, the United States unarguably carries the flag for the federalist model, while the majority of other nations, including France and China as prime examples, follow the unitary model. It is important to note that a calculation of an "optimal" government structure is impossible here, and that most nations operating on a federalist or unitary model incorporate elements, practices, and policy recommendations from the other model as they see fit. Absolutes in government structures are an impossibility due to the spontaneous nature of human society and continually changing world these societies exist in.

The implementation of the federalist model in the United States has, to an incalcuable extent, been successful in its ability to accommodate differences among populations and accelerate the United States' growth and development to that of the most economically, politically, and culturally powerful nation in the world. The principles, reasoning, and philosophy behind the federalist model come _largely_ from the helpfully titled "Federalist Papers" by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. In these articles, the authors argue for the necessity of a federalist model to ensure the rights of the people, the balance of power in the federal government, between the state and federal governments, and the stability of the nation. In doing so, they recognized what all conceptions of political structure must, "Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under one government (Hamilton, Alexander, Madison, James, and Jay, John)". This is to say, the federalist model is not perfect, but it does an admirable job at restraining the power of the government--to the consternation of the intellectual desire to continually influence society in favor of the 'right' way--and ensuring the rights of the people.

This is not to claim that the unitary model is incapable of ensuring the rights of the people or the balance of power in the government, but rather that the federalist model makes that the central pillar for all governmental design choices. The unitary model, as seen in France[^3] is primarily oriented around operational efficiency and standardization, with the central government being the most 'direct' representation of the people, and thus having total dominion over the sub-governments. Some of the benefits of the unitary form of government are that it is easier to implement and change policy, the total scope of bureaucracy is smaller, and the central government does not require the level of cooperation for policy implementation that a federalist government does--smaller, faster, more nimble. France's national character makes it a poor data point for generalization, but on a strictly policy level it does show some of the potential drawbacks as well. Mixing the nature of the unitary model with French national character, "this state-society relationship a specific pattern of policy processes emerges. The state often formulates policies unilaterally, without first consulting groups that may be affected (Daemen, H. and Schap, L.)". This leads to the common protests and strikes that France is known for, as the people feel that they are not being heard by the government. This is partly due to the unitary nature of the government, but also due to the French national character, so this must be taken as something to be balanced by federalist elements in the Global Nation, but not as a reason for total rejection of the unitary model. Another obvious drawback of the unitary model is that it is, by its nature, unitary - the Global Nation holds a scope of diversity unparalleled among even the most heterogeneous of nation-states, and a unitary model _could_ struggle with a political environment aligned on ethnic or geographic lines instead of ideological ones. This is an issue that will be explored in more depth in the cultural and social sections of this examination, but within the context of government structure, it is a possible constraint to be aware of and considered.

<!-- Okay, so now on to combination to objectively scaleable with what the lower bounds look like. -->

[^1]: In the most literal sense, literally "the people" and "power" - the legitimacy, authority, and power of the government is derived from the people, the form of this representation will be discussed in a following section.
[^2]: For example, a high-level "protector" Global Nation government with Nozickean "night-watchman" state characteristics with very small local sub-governments. Interesting for a thought experiment on political philosophy, but not practical for a real-world government structure. Another example would be "lottocracy" as was once done in some ancient Greek city-states, in order to literally have a common man--in so far as a common man qualified as a citizen--be a leader. This is, again, interesting historically and philosophically, but not practical for the operations of a modern nation-state let alone a Global Nation.
[^3]: France will be the example for the unitary model for two reasons. First, I have studied it extensively for a previous work, and second, China, the world's most populous nation, an a unitary state, is not a democracy so lacks direct allegorical comparison to the Global Nation.
