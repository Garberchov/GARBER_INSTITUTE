(As part of the EU Section, why is part of what has been tried and what has failed)

#### II.1.a: Why is Switzerland in the Schengen Area but not the EU itself?
The European Union is the greatest attempt at creating at supranational state that has yet been tried, and it has brought a great deal of prosperity to the continent. However, it did not create a singular state but stopped short of that, and is instead a collection of states that simply work together on a number of issues. Switzerland, long known for its neutrality, non-interventionism, and strongly independent culture, is a lone gap in the map of European Union members in Central and Western Europe. A seemingly inconsistent outlier to their otherwise independent streak, Switzerland is a member of the highly integrated Schengen Area, which allows for free movement of people and goods across borders. In this case study, an examination of the reasons for Switzerland not joining the EU will be made, as well as the reasons for joining the Schengen Area. This examination will be made through the lens of why a nation would give up their sovereignty to join a global nation, and why simple cooperative unions(even highly integrated ones like the EU) aren't enough to solve major global issues.
