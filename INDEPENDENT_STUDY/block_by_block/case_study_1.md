(As part of the EU Section, why is part of what has been tried and what has failed)

#### II.1.a: Why is Switzerland in the Schengen Area but not the EU itself?
The European Union is the greatest attempt at creating at supranational state that has yet been tried, and it has brought a great deal of prosperity to the continent. However, it did not create a singular state but stopped short of that, and is instead a collection of states that simply work together on a number of issues. Switzerland, long known for its neutrality, non-interventionism, and strongly independent culture, is a lone gap in the map of European Union members in Central and Western Europe. A seemingly inconsistent outlier to their otherwise independent streak, Switzerland is a member of the highly integrated Schengen Area, which allows for free movement of people and goods across borders. In this case study, an examination of the reasons for Switzerland not joining the EU will be made, as well as the reasons for joining the Schengen Area. This examination will be made through the lens of states and their people prioritizing independence and national sovereignty as major aims unto themselves.

#### II.1.a.i: Why Switzerland declined to join the EU

Switzerland has a long history of independence and near obsessive neutrality in European and world affairs. It has served as the crossroads of Europe for centuries, and has been a place of refuge for those fleeing persecution, war, or strife. In fact, Swiss neutrality has become an integral part of Swiss National Identity, and they have not participated in a foreign war since 1815. This cycle of longer periods of neutrality and isolationism forging a stronger sense of national identity and independence has forged Swiss culture and politics into one deeply skeptical of foreign entanglements. This manifested itself in the 1992 decision(50.3% to 49.7%) to not join the wider European Economic Area(EEA), and the 2001 decision(76.8% to 23.2%) to not join the EU. The reasons for this are varied, but can be mainly be credited to four main reasons: Swiss national identity, lack of security concerns, too wealthy to gain dramatic benefits, and the Swiss system of direct democracy.

##### Swiss National Identity and Isolationism

As previously mentioned, the cycle of long periods of isolationism forging a stronger sense of Swiss identity as distinctly separate and inherently neutral thus making them more isolationist has become a dominant force. While it is impossible to pinpoint the absolute causes of this, both its geography and internal divisions have played a role. In terms of geography, Switzerland is incredibly difficult to invade due to the mountainous terrain and the fact that these "choke points" are easily defensible. Adding to this, there are few natural resources in Switzerland and thus little reason to embark on such an obviously expensive and difficult invasion. Regarding internal divisions, Switzerland is a country of four official languages and contains populations who were culturally tied to the German, French, and Italian states. Many of the twenty-six cantons have populations that could have been sympathetic to the states that surrounded them, and thus an active policy of neutrality was necessary to prevent internal divisions from spilling over into the international arena. Generations were needed in order to build a sufficiently cohesive Swiss culture, and by the time that culture was enshrined it contained neutrality as a key element. This policy of neutrality was formalized in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna, and has been a cornerstone of Swiss foreign policy ever since. 

This policy of individuation and neutrality in foreign policy is in stark relief when compared to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy(CFSP), which is a key part of the EU's supranational identity. The CFSP is a policy that is designed to create a common foreign policy for the EU, so that the EU can be seen as a more coherent actor on the world stage in comparison to a trade-bloc with a common market. While the strength of the CFSP has come into question(the war in Ukraine showed the EU's inability to form a single foreign policy for all of its states), the very concept of a common foreign policy is anathema to Switzerland and was a key decision in the continued rejection of EU membership.

#### Swiss Lack of Security Concerns

While nobody advocates that more security concerns are a good thing for a nation, the lack of security concerns for Switzerland has been a notable factor in its foreign policy decisions. As previously mentioned, Switzerland has not been involved in a foreign war since 1815, and has not been invaded since 1798. This is due to a combination of factors, including the previously mentioned geography, the lack of natural resources, and the fact that Switzerland has not been a major player on the European foreign policy stage, especially in comparison to its far larger neighbors. A notable exception to this was the Second World War, where Switzerland was bordered by the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Vichy France - however, the risk-reward calculation for invading the mountainous country was not worth the effort for the Axis powers, especially in consideration of the economic benefits that Switzerland provided to the Axis powers. 

In relation to Swiss dealings with the EU, the lack of security concerns has led to a lack of interest in the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy(CSDP), which is the EU's attempt at cohesive defense policy. While the CSDP has been criticized for its lack of cohesion and effectiveness, even if Switzerland was interested in joining the EU it wouldn't have any use for a collective defense policy because there are no security concerns that would necessitate it. Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria all have active security concerns due to their proximity to Russia, and thus the CSDP is an attractive part of EU membership for them. While not acting in the same way that NATO does, the CSDP does allow for cohesive action in the event of a security crisis for a member state. Switzerland has no such concerns, and thus no need for the CSDP - another strike against EU membership for the Swiss.

#### Switzerland is too wealthy already to gain dramatic benefits from EU membership

Switzerland is one of the wealthiest nations on earth, and has been for a long time. While the causes for this are varied, the fact remains that Switzerland has a very high standard of living. While Europe as a whole is wealthy, Switzerland far outstrips the EU in terms of GDP per capita and thus the promises of economic growth sound hollow compared to the economic growth that a nation like Romania, Bulgaria, or Croatia could expect.

This is not to say that Switzerland would not benefit from EU membership, but the benefits would be far less significant and when considering the diplomatic, political, and tax overheads of EU membership it adds a layer of skepticism to the idea of joining the EU. When looking at the graph, Switzerland stands out as a huge green dot in the center of Europe, and while Germany, France, Austria and Italy are certainly not poor nations, the benefits of protectionism and economic nationalism for Switzerland have done well for them. Already, the Swiss economy is highly integrated with the EU, but on their terms - they have a number of bilateral agreements with the EU that allow for trade favorable to both parties, without the need for EU membership. This allows Switzerland to maintain its independence and neutrality while still reaping the benefits of trade with the large population and economic base of the EU.

#### Swiss System of Direct Democracy

In the annals of political science, direct democracy is frequently viewed as "the one that got away", potentially excellent if implemented but requiring too much citizen participation to be truly effective. To more accurately define the terms in this case, Switzerland is in fact a semi-direct democracy wherein citizen input is taken and an elected executive branch puts the will of the citizenry into action. I will continue to use the term "direct democracy" for the sake of simplicity, and because Switzerland labels itself as such, but it is important to note that the Swiss system is not a pure direct democracy and that the implementation of an absolute direct democracy is more akin to anarchist political theory than anything else.
