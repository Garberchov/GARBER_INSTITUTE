#### Outline

```
- IV.1: Hold-overs from before the Global Nation.
  - IV.1.a: One of the preconditions was that the government structures of all the world's nations would be transferred to the Global Nation - how would a transition to new government structures be handled?
  - IV.1.b: How would national debt be handled? Would it be forgiven, or would it be transferred to the Global Nation? The Global Nation can't owe and be paid by itself, so how would this be handled? - IV.1.b.a: What happened to the debt of the Confederate States of America after the American Civil War?
    - IV.1.b.c: What happened to the debt of the East German government after German reunification?
  - IV.1.b.d: Is the "price of doing business" for the creation of the Global Nation the cancelling out of all state to state debt(obviously privately held debt would not be affected in this case), or is an addition to that wealth transfer mechanism relative to indebtedness the better way to handle this[III.2.a]?
    - IV.1.c: How would patents and intellectual property be handled? If one person owns a patent in one country, and another person in another country, and they are now both a part of the Global Nation, who owns the sole rights to the patent? - IV.2.c.a: I do not believe that any past example is relevant in this case, as it would the patents of EVERY country in the world being merged into a single patent/intellectual properly market. - IV.2.c.b: Is a grandfathered phase-out of patents the best way to handle this?

#### Response

Unifying the world's nations into a single entity would include the transfer of government structures, infrastructure, debt, patents, intellectual property, and other assets. While this is a monumental task, it is not unprecedented. This will not be narrative fiction of how the Global Nation could go about this, but rather an examination of how to structure such a transition to ensure maximal efficiency, minimal disruption, and to ensure that the transition to a Global Nation works in concert with the plans for the Global Nation's future. Each of these issues will be examined in turn with a specifical focus on how this political action--this is not an ordered economic transition, that is left for the market's own spontaneous organization--would accelerate the Global Nation's goals, and how it sets up for the future success of the Global Nation.

To begin with, the machinery of government: police, tax collectors, military[^1], and other government employees would be retained and employeed by the Global Nation. Without question, a large number of these employees would be let go over time, but starting from scratch without a beauracracy on day one of the Global Nation would be a disaster. While the faults of the old governments would be retained in the personnel that would be used for the transition to a Global Nation, under a new system some of the sychophants and self-serving individuals would perhaps change their ways under the new philosophy of the ascendant Global Nation. More than this, the functions of the retained individuals would be modified but not removed, as the necessity of a police force, tax collection, and beauracracy(all of which will change in form and function) don't go away with the creation of the Global Nation. Tax collection would look different because of the new taxation system and economic philosophy, policing would look different in many parts of the world due to the Global Nation's anti-corruption focus, the beauracracy would like different due to the more minimal part the Global Nation will be playing in the economy compared to pre-unificiation nations, but most of the functions would in essence remain.

The example of the semi-retenance of the East German government's beauracracy after German reunification is a good example of how this could be done. This example is not perfect, as much of the East German government was let go, but this was due to the completely contrary political and economic systems of East and West Germany. According to Hellmut Wollmann, "The GDR’s state was typical of the (post-Stalinist) ‘socialist’ state model based on the dual structure of the intertwined state and communist party apparatus which, by 1990, was made up of around 1000 administrative units with about 2.1 million functionaries and employees (Wollmann, Hellmut)." Much of the East German government was let go for either ideological or functional reasons--not a socialist state, the market managed production, not the government--but large portions of the staff were retained or retrained for the new government, "the new _Land_ governments were faced with the decision of whether to liquidate the administrative units ‘inherited’ from the GDR state or retain and fit them into a new organisational architecture. In pursuit of this task, ‘often the ruins of the former administrative structure with its personnel and material equipment became a quarry for the new administrative units’ (Wollmann, Hellmut)." This provides a valuable insight into merging together the world's governmental structures, created for their own government's economic and political systems, into a single entity with a unity of purpose. The Global Nation's economic and political systems as defined in this paper are significantly different from those of the current world's nations, somewhat as a function of it being a single entity, but not totally polar opposites as East and West Germany were. The scale of it would be much larger, and many of the states unified into the Global Nation would have similarly large and complex governmental structures for citizen and economic control as East Germany did, but the principle of retaining and retraining the staff--save for high level officials and those who are ideologically opposed to the Global Nation's goals--is a good one.

The question of governmental debt is an existential one for the formation of a Global Nation, one without a clear answer. In the case of individuals buying foreign or domestic government debt, it would go against the spirit and goals of the Global Nation--not to mention the economic philosophy, which holds with the liberal tradition in considering property rights to be fundamental--to not honor those obligations as they were made in the pre-integration parts of the integrated Global Nation. In the case of State-to-State debt, there are valid arguements for both wiping the slate clean as it would effectively be the Global Nation owing itself, and for transferring the debt to the Global Nation and functionally administering it as a 'gradient' to tax distribution until the amount owed is paid. Both of these must be explored, as a plan to deal with the debt is fundamental to the economic and political stability of the Global Nation, and planning for the scope of its operations.

[^1]: This will be the sole exception to the precondition that military matters will not be discussed here - the military is a government institution, and as such, will be transferred to the Global Nation. How, if, and where the combined military forces of the world continue to operate is irrelevant for the purposes of this examination.
