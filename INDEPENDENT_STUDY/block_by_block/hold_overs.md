### Hold-Overs

#### Outline

```
- IV.1: Hold-overs from before the Global Nation.
  - IV.1.a: One of the preconditions was that the government structures of all the world's nations would be transferred to the Global Nation - how would a transition to new government structures be handled?
  - IV.1.b: How would national debt be handled? Would it be forgiven, or would it be transferred to the Global Nation? The Global Nation can't owe and be paid by itself, so how would this be handled? - IV.1.b.a: What happened to the debt of the Confederate States of America after the American Civil War?
    - IV.1.b.c: What happened to the debt of the East German government after German reunification?
  - IV.1.b.d: Is the "price of doing business" for the creation of the Global Nation the cancelling out of all state to state debt(obviously privately held debt would not be affected in this case), or is an addition to that wealth transfer mechanism relative to indebtedness the better way to handle this[III.2.a]?
    - IV.1.c: How would patents and intellectual property be handled? If one person owns a patent in one country, and another person in another country, and they are now both a part of the Global Nation, who owns the sole rights to the patent? - IV.2.c.a: I do not believe that any past example is relevant in this case, as it would the patents of EVERY country in the world being merged into a single patent/intellectual properly market. - IV.2.c.b: Is a grandfathered phase-out of patents the best way to handle this?

#### Response

Unifying the world's nations into a single entity would include the transfer of government structures, infrastructure, debt, patents, intellectual property, and other assets. While this is a monumental task, it is not unprecedented. This will not be narrative fiction of how the Global Nation could go about this, but rather an examination of how to structure such a transition to ensure maximal efficiency, minimal disruption, and to ensure that the transition to a Global Nation works in concert with the plans for the Global Nation's future. Each of these issues will be examined in turn with a specifical focus on how this political action--this is not an ordered economic transition, that is left for the market's own spontaneous organization--would accelerate the Global Nation's goals, and how it sets up for the future success of the Global Nation.

To begin with, the machinery of government: police, tax collectors, military[^1], and other government employees would be retained and employeed by the Global Nation. Without question, a large number of these employees would be let go over time, but starting from scratch without a beauracracy on day one of the Global Nation would be a disaster. While the faults of the old governments would be retained in the personnel that would be used for the transition to a Global Nation, under a new system some of the sychophants and self-serving individuals would perhaps change their ways under the new philosophy of the ascendant Global Nation. More than this, the functions of the retained individuals would be modified but not removed, as the necessity of a police force, tax collection, and beauracracy(all of which will change in form and function) don't go away with the creation of the Global Nation. Tax collection would look different because of the new taxation system and economic philosophy, policing would look different in many parts of the world due to the Global Nation's anti-corruption focus, the beauracracy would like different due to the more minimal part the Global Nation will be playing in the economy compared to pre-unificiation nations, but most of the functions would in essence remain.

[^1]: This will be the sole exception to the precondition that military matters will not be discussed here - the military is a government institution, and as such, will be transferred to the Global Nation. How, if, and where the combined military forces of the world continue to operate is irrelevant for the purposes of this discussion.
