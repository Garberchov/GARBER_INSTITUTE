III.3: Discussion of taxation structures, and how to balance them against huge regional differences in both income AND cost of living.

- III.3.a: Denmark vs USA vs Canada taxation and government spending.
  - III.3.a.a: High-taxation for the large government services for individual comfort, but poor industry/innovation/entrepreneurship(low social mobility as differnece between rich and poor is small in absolute terms, but tax rates go up dramatically)
  - III.3.a.b: Low-taxation for a small amount of government services for individual comfort, but a large industrial/innovative base, and a large amount of entrepreneurship(comparatively high social mobility).
  - III.3.a.c: Mid-taxation for the a smaller amount of government services for individual comfort, but a respectable industrial and innovative economic base.
- III.3.b: A system of objectively scalable government [In it's taxation elements, it is a whole government reform plan but that goes in IV.5]
  - III.3.b.a: A Minimally Graduated Progressive Tax, where it is a scaled bracket system based on three major percentages of income, with those brackets being relative to the cost of living and average income of the region.

Nation comparisons will be somewhat brief, but will be used to illustrate the range of possibilities in taxation structures and their trade-offs. There is no optimal taxation structure, but choosing one that is _in line with the economic philosophy of the global nation_ is the key here. This is simply a "child" of the economic philosophy which has been previously established.

<!-- Taxation in Denmark -->

<!-- Taxation in Canada -->

<!-- Taxation in the USA, include relevant parts of Tax Foundation plan(just to illustrate difficulties in compliance) -->

<!-- Taxation as a window into model of objectively scalable government, which will be discussed more widely in political structures as part of federalism vs unitary; parlimentary vs direct. -->

<!-- Minimally Graduated Progressive Tax, flat tax from 12 to 18% on all sales save for food and housing. -->
