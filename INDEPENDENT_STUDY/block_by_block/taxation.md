III.3: Discussion of taxation structures, and how to balance them against huge regional differences in both income AND cost of living.

- III.3.a: Denmark vs USA vs Canada taxation and government spending.
  - III.3.a.a: High-taxation for the large government services for individual comfort, but poor industry/innovation/entrepreneurship(low social mobility as differnece between rich and poor is small in absolute terms, but tax rates go up dramatically)
  - III.3.a.b: Low-taxation for a small amount of government services for individual comfort, but a large industrial/innovative base, and a large amount of entrepreneurship(comparatively high social mobility).
  - III.3.a.c: Mid-taxation for the a smaller amount of government services for individual comfort, but a respectable industrial and innovative economic base.
- III.3.b: A system of objectively scalable government [In it's taxation elements, it is a whole government reform plan but that goes in IV.5]
  - III.3.b.a: A Minimally Graduated Progressive Tax, where it is a scaled bracket system based on three major percentages of income, with those brackets being relative to the cost of living and average income of the region.

Nation comparisons will be somewhat brief, but will be used to illustrate the range of possibilities in taxation structures and their trade-offs. There is no optimal taxation structure, but choosing one that is _in line with the economic philosophy of the global nation_ is the key here. This is simply a "child" of the economic philosophy which has been previously established.

<!-- Intro -->

> "Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes." - Benjamin Franklin (NCC Staff, 2023)

In seeking to establish a global nation, how it will be organized, its economic philosophy, its political structures, what the social and cultural impacts will be, and how it will be governed, all of these come as downstream implementations--or not--of how the Global Nation's government will be funded. Perhaps no question is more fiercely debated than taxes in the modern political discourse around the world--and it is no less important in the context of the Global Nation. This section will discuss the various taxation structures of Denmark, the United States, and Canada, and how they balance the social services they provide with the economic growth, freedom, and innovation they foster. The relative merits of ranking these against each other is not a burden this section will bear, but instead illustrate which of these goals most align in the abstract and in implementation with the economic philosophy of the Global Nation.

<!-- Taxation in Denmark -->

Denmark is renowed in many circles as a nation with a high standard of living, a strong social safety net, and a high level of government services. This is a direct result of their government's economic philosophy emphasizing large government services for individual comfort. This unavoidably has a cost[^1], and Denmark's tax rates are among the highest in the world, with specifically high rates on personal income, sales tax, and a 25% value-added tax (PWC, 2024). The result of this has been a high median standard of living, low poverty rates, and a high level of happiness among its citizens--ranking second in the world behind Finland, a nation with a simlar economic philosophy (World Population Review, 2024). However, this high level of taxation has stifled industry to a large extent, with low social mobility and a lack of entrepreneurship and innovation. The few major industries in Denmark have had to move up-market in order to stay competitive with other nations with lower tax rates, lower wages, and more innovation. Technology imports are high, and services make up a disproportionate number of jobs, 78.81% in 2022(Statista), relative to their GDP, 66.31% in 2022(Statista). This is a direct result of the high tax rates and the lack of innovation and entrepreneurship that comes as a consequence of that choice. When the difference between rich and poor is small in absolute terms, but tax rates go up dramatically, there is little incentive to innovate, to take risks, or to start a business. Moreover, those who have a natural inclination to do so(or to work in high-tech industries) frequently find better job opportunities, higher wages, and lower taxes in nations with differing economic philosophies. Denmark was already a comparatively well-developed, high-income nation when it adopted this economic philosophy, and it has been able to sustain it as a result, however as a model for a Global Nation, it is not ideal as the entire world under the Global Nation would need to start and maintain a rate of rapid economic growth which simply isn't feasible under this economic philosophy, nor is it compatible with the economic philosophy of the Global Nation previously established.

<!-- Taxation in Canada -->

Canada presents an example of a half-way point between Denmark and the United States in terms of taxation and government services. Canada has a "mid-level" taxation, and representative economic philosophy, which tries to balance social services with the insurance of continued domestic innovation and industry. How succesfully Canada has achieved this cannot be determined, as a number of external factors assist and detract from this goal: it is important to briefly examine these as the world as a whole would, under the Gloal Nation, hold sway over all of these external factors. Prime among these factors is proximity to the industrial, innovative powerhouse of the United States. This leads to a relatively easy flow of capital, technology, and labor between the two nations(U.S. Department of State), and has allowed Canada to leverage this proximity to maintain technological and industrial competitiveness despite higher taxes and a smaller skilled labor base. This is counteracted by the large number of skilled workers(specifically in high-tech or industrially relevant fields) who leave Canada for the United States, where job opportunities may be more plentiful, wages higher, and taxes lower(Singer, R. Colin). Critically, this technological innovation accelerated by Canadian expats in the United States does flow back into Canada, but certainly not to the same degree as if it were done domestically--which, as a function of proximity to the United States and the economic philosophy of Canada is significantly smaller in scale. Another factor here is natural resources: Canada has large oil, natural gas, and mineral reserves which have been a major boon to Canadian industry and government coffers. These resources have provided a positive external boost to Canada's economy, allowing for a somewhat greater allocation of resources to social programs than otherwise would be possible. However, these--unlike some other nations--are not the primary driver of the economy nor does it fund seemingly infinite social services.

As specifically pertains to taxation, Canada has a progressive tax system, with roughly average rates of taxation on personal income compared to other OECD nations(Taxing Wages, 2024 Canada), it has higher capital gains taxes which are set to climb further, and a lower barrier at which the highest tax bracket is reached, and a 12.4% Standard VAT rate(OECD). On average, this has led to a relatively stable economy, a high level of labor force participation, and a respectable level of innovation and industry. However this has all been achieved while in continual deficit spending, and a fairly high level of government debt without the economic growth to match. In addition, Canada has a poor and worsening productivity problem, "Back in 1984, the Canadian economy was producing 88% of the value generated by the US economy per hour. Thatâ€™s not great. But by 2022, Canadian productivity had fallen to just 71% of that of the United States. Over this same period of time, Canada also fell behind our G7 peers, with only Italy seeing a larger decline in productivity relative to the United States."(Rogers, Carolyn). This is a direct result of the economic philosophy of Canada which through its taxation and government spending has not been able to foster the innovation and industry necessary to keep up with the United States, and has actively decelerated higher-tech industry and innovation. Canada's economic philosophy is one of balance, and it is on a high-wire act between the United States and Denmark, and it is not clear that it will be able to maintain this balance in the long term. Simply put, it is being thoroughly outcompeted by the United States in terms of personal opportunity: why would a Canadian who went to an elite university(subsidizied by the Canadian government) stay in Canada when they could make more money, have more job opportunities, and pay less in taxes in the United States? The only justification for doing so is a sense of national pride or the social services provided by the government, but as more of the highest productivity talent leaves Canada, the less likely it is that the next generation will stay. While Canada has maintained a respectable level of industry and innovation, and as rapid economic and productivity growth, as well as personal opportunity are the key tenets of the economic philosophy of the Global Nation, Canada is not a directly applicable model for the Global Nation.

<!-- Taxation in the USA, include relevant parts of Tax Foundation plan(just to illustrate difficulties in compliance) -->

<!-- Taxation as a window into model of objectively scalable government, which will be discussed more widely in political structures as part of federalism vs unitary; parlimentary vs direct. -->

<!-- Minimally Graduated Progressive Tax, flat tax from 12 to 18% on all sales save for food and housing. -->

<!-- Benefits in terms of stability, labor force participation, innovation, economic growth, and citizen well-being(health care despite not being government funded, life expectancy) -->

[^1]: Unless it can be funded directly from the government's own revenue, like in Norway or Saudi Arabia. However, Denmark--while having some oil and gas reserves--is not a petrostate and does not have "black gold" to fund extremely generous social services.
