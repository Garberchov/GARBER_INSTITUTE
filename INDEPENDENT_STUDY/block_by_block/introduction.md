FROM THE DESK OF ANDREW GARBER:

I.1: Vision of an integrated world, free of borders and boundaries between people, ideas, information, and goods. 
 - I.1.a: Borders are artificial constructs, a human invention, individuals are no different from each other based on where they were born, and only exist as the relic of a bygone era of tribalism and fiefdom.
 - I.1.b: Reasons why making an integrated world is necessary, a discussion of the systemic failings and missed opportunities of the current world of borders, boundaries, and friction between nations.
	- I.1.b.a: Amount of resources wasted on international conflict, and how that lessened tax burden(NOT state spending being redirected to social programs) could further the prosperity of humanity.
	- I.1.b.b: The exponential effects of the elimination of barriers for ideas and humans would lead to a considerable increase in the rate of innovation, and the subsequent increase in the rate of economic growth. Silicon Valley is a prime example of this, due to having a high concentration of innovative people and capital, it has led the world in technological innovation for decades.
 - I.1.c. Preconditions, Premises, Terminology, Assumptions, and Non-Relevant Topics
	- I.1.c.a: Name for "The Global Nation" - "Global Nation" is a general political science term, but we need a name for the specific Global Nation that is the subject of this paper.
	- I.1.c.b: GDP and GDP per capita are the primary metrics we will be using to measure the economic success/power of nations in this paper - standard of living does not adequately capture any innovation, industrial power, or economic influence that a nation has.
	- I.1.c.c: The political science terms "left" and "right" will not be used in this paper, as they are specific to the political climates of individual nations. The philosophies themselves will be the terms used, such as "democratic socialism" or "libertarianism" instead of "left" and "right".
 - I.1.d: Fundamental beliefs and values of the Global Nation.
 - I.1.e. *Thesis Statement*, a statement of the intended goal of the paper through a discussion of potential economic and political structures of a single world government, and the benefits in the political, economic, cultural, and social spheres of such a government.


NOTE: Don't be so didactic that my mom throws up.

#### I.1 The Vision
Earth is a single planet, made home by humanity. As far as can be observed, we are the single greatest species to have ever existed, and we have the potential to do so much more. Yet, for a single species, we are remarkably divided. Our tribal past lives on today in the form of nations, borders, and boundaries. Within one nation, you can walk from one end to the other as a member in good standing, but cross a line on a map, and you are a foreigner: an outsider, a stranger, a potential enemy. More than culturally you are deemed underworthy of the greatness of that nation's people, of its history, of being part of its future. It is them against us, and we are always the good guys. This is the world we live in, a world of division, one in which every individual lives a smaller life, a life less than they could have lived, a life less than they deserve for being isolated from their fellows. Tribalism was a useful evolutionary tool for survival, it allowed us to collect and distribute resources more efficiently, protect ourselves from outside threats, and eventually provide the caloric surplus to support a more advanced civilization: specialization, justice, trade, war. Organization of people into groups, and groups of groups, was one of humanity's greatest achievements--self-organization of disparate members of a species into civilizations. But that was then, and this is now. Earth does not hold many civilizations, but one--it has done so for at least the past half-century, and it is time to recognize that fact. This examination does not seek to denigrate that past, but to recognize that is the past, and in this present it is a hindrance to the further acceleration of progress for the future. A considerable portion of humanity lives beneath their dignity as members of our species not for lack of access to resources, but for lack of opportunities to make the most of their talents, and to be rewarded thereof.

This is not a call for unification on cultural or imperial grounds. Many individuals, many leaders, many nations have sought to unify the world under their banner, to make the world in their image, to make the world their own to support their own ends. This is not that. This is not an examination of a conquered world, nor a utopian one: it is an examination of a world that has already been conquered throwing off the intellectual, societal, and political shackles of the past. 

Despite the prevailing air that we have never been worse, done worse, or looked to a worse future, a worse fate, we have never been better. We have never been more capable of greatness, of goodness, of justice and cooperation in the uplifting of our species to one of a mythology. Humanity, not just the species but the civilization, the culture, the society, the world, has the potential to be *of* one. Not one people, not one culture, not one society, but one nation. A world of people and peoples, of ideas and collaboration, of innovation and prosperity, of peace and justice. A world without borders, without boundaries, without friction between fellows, without the artificial constructs of the past that hold us back from the future. A Global Nation.

#### I.1.A Why not Borders?

If a value is given to being alongside ones own race, culture, ethnicity, or other division of humanity that is based on some quirk of birth, then a border between "us" and "them" is necessary and valuable. That is the lesson of tribalism: the independent civilizations of humanity developed by focusing the efforts of "us" against "them", and the borders between them were the physical manifestation of that division. But when taken to consider that those subdivisions of humanity, an evolutionary IFF(Identification Friend or Foe) system, are in fact arbitrary, then the value of borders--being among like individuals--becomes not only unjust but a hindrance to the political, economic, cultural, and technological progress of humanity.
