FROM THE DESK OF ANDREW GARBER:

I.1: Vision of an integrated world, free of borders and boundaries between people, ideas, information, and goods. 
 - I.1.a: Borders are artificial constructs, a human invention, individuals are no different from each other based on where they were born, and only exist as the relic of a bygone era of tribalism and fiefdom.
 - I.1.b: Reasons why making an integrated world is necessary, a discussion of the systemic failings and missed opportunities of the current world of borders, boundaries, and friction between nations.
	- I.1.b.a: Amount of resources wasted on international conflict, and how that lessened tax burden(NOT state spending being redirected to social programs) could further the prosperity of humanity.
	- I.1.b.b: The exponential effects of the elimination of barriers for ideas and humans would lead to a considerable increase in the rate of innovation, and the subsequent increase in the rate of economic growth. Silicon Valley is a prime example of this, due to having a high concentration of innovative people and capital, it has led the world in technological innovation for decades.
*Thesis Statement*, a statement of the intended goal of the paper through a discussion of potential economic and political structures of a single world government, and the benefits in the political, economic, cultural, and social spheres of such a government.
 - I.1.c. Preconditions, Premises, Terminology, Assumptions, and Non-Relevant Topics
	- I.1.c.a: Name for "The Global Nation" - "Global Nation" is a general political science term, but we need a name for the specific Global Nation that is the subject of this paper.
	- I.1.c.b: GDP and GDP per capita are the primary metrics we will be using to measure the economic success/power of nations in this paper - standard of living does not adequately capture any innovation, industrial power, or economic influence that a nation has.
	- I.1.c.c: The political science terms "left" and "right" will not be used in this paper, as they are specific to the political climates of individual nations. The philosophies themselves will be the terms used, such as "democratic socialism" or "libertarianism" instead of "left" and "right".
 - I.1.d: Fundamental beliefs and values of the Global Nation.

#### I.1 The Vision
Earth is a single planet, made home by humanity. As far as can be observed, we are the single greatest species to have ever existed, and have the potential to do so much more. Yet, for a single species, we are remarkably divided. Our tribal past lives on today in the form of nations, borders, and boundaries. Within one nation, you can walk from one end to the other as a member in good standing, but cross a line on a map, and you are a foreigner: an outsider, a stranger, a potential enemy. More than culturally but teleologically, you are deemed unworthy of the greatness of that nation's people, of its history, of being part of its future. It is them against us, and we are always the good guys. This is the world we live in, a world of division, one in which every individual lives a smaller life, a life less than they could have lived, a life less than they deserve for being isolated from their fellows. Tribalism was a useful evolutionary tool for survival, it allowed us to collect and distribute resources more efficiently, protect ourselves from outside threats, and eventually provide the caloric surplus to support a more advanced civilization: specialization, justice, trade, war. Organization of people into groups, and groups of groups, was one of humanity's greatest achievements--self-organization of disparate members of a species into civilizations. But that was then, and this is now. Earth does not hold many civilizations, but one--it has done so for the last seventy years, and it is time to recognize that fact. This examination does not seek to denigrate that past, but to recognize that is the past, and in this present it is a hindrance to the further acceleration of progress. A considerable portion of humanity lives beneath their dignity as members of our species not for lack of access to resources, but for lack of opportunities to make the most of their talents, and to be rewarded thereof.

This is not a call for unification on cultural or imperial grounds. Many individuals, leaders, and nations have sought to unify the world under their banner, to make the world in their image, to make the world their own to support their own ends. This is not that. This is not an examination of a conquered world, nor a utopian one: it is an examination of a world that has already been conquered throwing off the intellectual, societal, and political shackles of the past. 

Despite the prevailing air that we have never been worse, done worse, or looked to a worse future, a worse fate, we have never been better. We have never been more capable of greatness, of goodness, of justice and cooperation in the uplifting of our species to one of mythology. Humanity, not just the species but the civilization, the culture, the society, the world, has the potential to be *of* one. Not one people, not one culture, not one society, but one nation. A world of people and peoples, of ideas and collaboration, of innovation and prosperity, of peace and justice. A world without borders, without boundaries, without friction between fellows, without the artificial constructs of the past that hold us back from a united future. A Global Nation.

#### I.1.A Why not Borders?

If a value is given to being alongside ones own race, culture, ethnicity, or other division of humanity that is based on some quirk of birth, then a border between "us" and "them" is necessary and valuable. That is the lesson of tribalism: independent civilizations of humanity developed by focusing the efforts of "us" against "them", and the borders between them were the physical manifestation of that division. But when taken to consider that those subdivisions of humanity, an evolutionary IFF(Identification Friend or Foe) system, are in fact arbitrary, then the value of borders--being among like individuals--becomes not only unjust but a hindrance to the political, economic, cultural, and technological progress of humanity.

The modern nation, one of boundaries keeping its people--aligned by birth within its area as deserving of its specific and unmatched greatness--from the rest of humanity, is a direct descendant of the ancient fiefdom, harkening back to the rights of the ruler and his subjects. As David D. Warren says in his "The Nature of the Nation-State System", "Each member-state has certain characteristics entitling it to admission-a defined territory, a permanent population, the capacity to enter into relations with other states, and most important of all, sovereignty. For every state is the supreme law-maker and law-enforcer within its defined territory, recognizing no external authority as superior to itself. (Warren, 149),", which is a remarkably similar set of characteristics to those of the Oath of Supremacy of 16th century England, "I ... do utterly testify and declare in my conscience that the Queen's Highness is the only supreme governor of this realm, ... in all spiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes, as temporal, and that no foreign prince, person, prelate, state or potentate hath or ought to have any jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre-eminence or authority ecclesiastical or spiritual within this realm; (Elizabethan.org)." These connections are not accidental but are the result of the evolution of the nation-state from the dynastic state, one in which the force of the ruler--gaining legitmacy from god, arms, or other means--was the only force that mattered, and the area in which that force was applied to the exception of all others was his state. 

When defined in these terms, the boundaries of the state being the sole region in which a monopoly on force can be maintained to the exclusion of others--even with the consent of the governed--these boundaries seem less like the natural divisions of humanity into groups for just and efficient resource distribution, and more like the arbitrary divisions into rulers' fiefdoms. Even in a modern democratic(or representative) state, to jealously guard the borders of the state, of the democracy, to those who are born within it, or jump through sufficient hoops to be admitted, is to deny the potential of the individual to be a member of what its guardians would freely admit to be a "superior" nation. If the nation whose borders must be guarded is so far greater, wiser, more just, and the productivity of one person is greater than none, then the nation is less than it could be by the exclusion of that person. More than this, nations built upon principles of liberalism--the democracies and republics, the most just and free of the world's nations--are sacrificing these pricinples upon the altar of the political boundary. While freedom of speech, the press, religion, and assembly are held as the highest of values, the freedom of movement, of association, of trade, without the interference of the state, are held as secondary to the state's monopoly on force within its borders to the pursuit of its "national interest". This careful sacrifice of equally great pillars of the liberal tradition upon which these states are built for the purposes of centralizing and fortifying the state's authority within its borders has become self-perpetuating, and self-interested, as the consenting governed have dealt themselves greater shares of the state's wealth through ever more social programs, and thus seek to protect their share of the pie by limiting the number of those who can partake in it.

Even if you believe that self-contained, homogeous ethnic or nationally-identify groups have the right to exclude others from their territory, even that must be weighed against the opportunity cost of frictionless trade with other such polities, let alone the inclusion of a larger--and potentially more skilled--workforce from outside of the defined ethnic/national group. Excluding the workforce arguement, import duties and tariffs in trade between two individuals or enterprises in different nations are a tax on the consumer and the economy as a whole, and decrease the quantity of purchasing the consumer could do without these measures. In addition, if purchasing from abroad, the extra-markup on the goods--for example, clothing--decreases the total market able/willing to purchase an enterprises' product, and in doing so stifling world economic growth or innovation that would benefit the consumer through lower prices, higher quality, or more variety. The United States, the world's largest economy, places a 75.8% import duty on knitted or crocheted clothing, and an 83.3% duty on non-knitted or crocheted clothing. Despite this, almost every label on a piece of clothing bought in America will say "Bangladesh", "Pakistan", or "Vietnam", despite these heavy duties. In effect, the consumer is paying a tax to the state for the privilege of buying a product that is not made in America, and the state is using that tax to fund its social programs, or to protect its domestic industry(which is paying for the high import duties on foreign goods through lobbying). This is not a case unique to the United States of America, but instead illustrates how much "friction", wasted money, time, and effort, is spent through economic borders--subsidies, tariffs, import duties, and other measures--that could instead vanish and lead to a more prosperous world.

In totality, nationalities, ethnicities, and other divisions of humanity are human fictions: invented for the purposes of survival, perpetuated for the purposes of further advancement of humanity, and then for their own sake either for the purposes of the state or the individual, senn as valuable ends in themselves. Political boundaries are the physical manifestation of these fictions, and are unnecessary, unjust, and a hindrance to the progress of humanity. Our world grows more connected, more prosperous, more peaceful, and more just when these boundaries are removed, and without political boundaries artificially dividing humanity, why have more than one nation representing humanity?

#### I.1.B What does a Global Nation Solve?	(Why not separate nations without borders?)

The Global Nation will not bring about utopia on Earth by its nature, but it would bring about a world that is more prosperous, more peaceful, more just, and more innovative than the world of today. It would bring us one step closer. The Global Nation would bring about a world in which the resources wasted on international conflict, direct or indirect, trade-wars or shooting wars, could be left in the pockets of the people, and allow them to allocate those resources to their own ends. The compulsion of the state spending its citizens money to protect them from the opponent state doing the same is a waste of resources in a singularly rational sense, and necessarily unjust in a moral sense. The purpose of the Global Nation is not to expand the reach of the state horizontally, across the Earth, nor vertically, into the lives of its citizens, but to eliminate the state interference in the daily lives of citizens that was previously done for the purpose of state-to-state competition.

To return to David D. Warren's "The Nature of the Nation-State System", his definition--one widely accepted in principle in the political science field--of three of the fundamental characteristics of a modern state being, "a defined territory ... the capacity to enter into relations with other states ... every state ... [being] the supreme law-maker and law-enforcer within its defined territory, recognizing no external authority as superior to itself (Warren, 149)," make it clear that the modern collection of states are engaged in more of a protection-racket, justified upon the consent of the citizenry for lack of a better option, than a collection of just and free societies coexisting with different values and cultures. Some may support the elimination of boundaries between states allowing for free-trade and travel, but support the maintenance of our current collection of states for the purposes of competition, and ensuring that people of distinctive views or characteristics can live in a society that reflects those views or characteristics. This is a noble goal, but it is not one that is served by the current system of states, nor one that would be achieved by keeping that system of states and removing the borders. In addition, if you keep the current system of states--with huge disparities in taxation systems to fund social programs--you end up with a natural incentive for mass migration to social services and mass-flight of capital to lower-tax jurisdictions. The Global Nation, in its elimination of boundaries, removes the incentive for mass migration to social services, as whatever the degree of social services anywhere would be equaled anywhere else[^1] and the incentive for mass-flight of capital to lower-tax jurisdictions, as the tax rate would be the same everywhere. In addition, the welfare of the citizenry is better ensured by the greater economic growth that would result from the elimination of barriers to trade and the movement of people, allowing a more efficient market to produce more goods and services at lower prices, and allowing to purchase more of them due to lower taxes and the elimination of import duties and tariffs.

This economic growth of a global nation wouldn't just be ensured by the greater consumer purchasing power and the greater efficiency of the market, but by the greater rate of innovation that would result from the elimination of barriers to the movement of people and ideas. Silicon Valley, the most innovative place on Earth for the last 50 years, is so because of the high concentration of innovative people and capital in one place. In the modern day this concentration is notably restricted due to the difficulty of moving to the United States, and as such smaller sub-concentrations of talent have sprung up in other places around the world. This is absolutely a good thing, not having all of the world's innovation in one place, but all of these places could benefit from more, and more diverse, talent and capital. Not only would the Global Nation assist in the education of the billions lacking it in the world, but it would allow for the free movement of those educated individuals to the places where they could best use their talents: not restricting them to their home countries or the countries that would take them. The benefits of technology rapidly flow horziontally across the world and vertically down the cost-axis, so the addition of more people to the world's most innovative places(a force multiplier) would lead to a greater rate of innovation, and the subsequent improvement to human prosperity. This notably hasn't been achieved by the states-without-borders model of the European Union, in-part due to their own difficult immigration policies, but also due to a continual focus on individual states' interests in *each* having a piece of the pie, a small tech-hub of their own, rather than one-city or one-region having the whole pie and the effects radiating outwards.

Counterintuitively, it is one of the logical followings of the elimination of individual states and thus their dependence on smaller blocs of voters to maintain power, that the Global Nation would be more tolerant of different views, cultures, and peoples than the current system of states. Not due to government-mandated "cut-outs", but due to a systemically level playing field for all individuals, and the lack of a political incentive to be against "the other". There will always be factions within a democratic state of any form, it is simply the nature of individuals to politically organize with those they can agree with on issues that are important to them, but in a nation where you can't expel, persecute, or otherwise intimidate those to which you hold prejudice to leave your nation, tolerance becomes more likely. In addition, with the greater flow of people and ideas across the world, the greater rate of innovation, and the greater economic growth, the incentive to be against "the other" is lessened, as the benefits of cooperation with "the other" are more apparent. There will certainly be prejudiced people in a Global Nation, but the systemic incentives to act on that prejudice are lessened, and the benefits of cooperation with those you may otherwise be prejudiced towards--immigrants, people of different religions, people of different x, y, or z--are more apparent.

#### I.1.C: The Structure, Function, and Benefits of the Formation of a Global Nation
<!-- Thesis -->
The arbitrary divisions between nations hinder human progress, prosperity, and fellowship by restricting the free movement of people, ideas, goods, and capital. The formation of a Global Nation that eliminates these barriers is both inevitable and desirable to enable humanity to reach its full potential across all spheres of life. This paper will examine the historical attempts at forming a Global Nation, or the closest approximations thereof, propose potential economic and political structures for a world government, explore the societal and cultural implications, and analyze the immense benefits of a unified world, including accelerated economic growth, increased innovation, greater cultural exchange, and a more just and peaceful society. Ultimately, the unification of humanity under a single flag is necessary for us to overcome the challenges we face, safeguard our planet and our species, and achieve our highest aspirations as a species.
