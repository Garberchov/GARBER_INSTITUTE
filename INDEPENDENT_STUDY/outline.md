## I: Premise and Introduction

I.1: Vision of an integrated world, free of borders and boundaries between people, ideas, information, and goods. 
 - I.1.a: Borders are artificial constructs, a human invention, individuals are no different from each other based on where they were born, and only exist as the relic of a bygone era of tribalism and fiefdom.
 - I.1.b: Reasons why making an integrated world is necessary, a discussion of the systemic failings and missed opportunities of the current world of borders, boundaries, and friction between nations.
	- I.1.b.a: Amount of resources wasted on international conflict, and how that lessened tax burden(NOT state spending being redirected to social programs) could further the prosperity of humanity.
  - I.1.b.b: The exponential effects of the elimination of barriers for ideas and humans would lead to a considerable increase in the rate of innovation, and the subsequent increase in the rate of economic growth. Silicon Valley is a prime example of this, due to having a high concentration of innovative people and capital, it has led the world in technological innovation for decades.
 - I.1.c. Preconditions, Premises, Terminology, Assumptions, and Non-Relevant Topics
  - I.1.c.a: Name for "The Global Nation" - "Global Nation" is a general political science term, but we need a name for the specific Global Nation that is the subject of this paper.
  - I.1.c.b: GDP and GDP per capita are the primary metrics we will be using to measure the economic success/power of nations in this paper - standard of living does not adequately capture any innovation, industrial power, or economic influence that a nation has.
 - I.1.d: Fundamental beliefs and values of the Global Nation.
 - I.1.e. *Thesis Statement*, a statement of the intended goal of the paper through a discussion of potential economic and political structures of a single world government, and the benefits in the political, economic, cultural, and social spheres of such a government.

## II: What has been tried, and what has failed.

II.1. The EU
 - II.1.a.: Case study on why Switzerland is part of the Schengen Area, but not the EU. 
  <!-- FIll In The Outline -->
  - II.1.a.i: Why Switzerland declined to join the EU.
    - II.1.a.i.a: Strong sense of national identity, isolationist. 
		- > This can later be said to not be a factor as the Global Nation wouldn't dissolve national identity, just national borders - it isn't a conquest and assimilation, it is the state equivelant of a merger of two companies.
    - II.1.a.i.b: Has no security concerns, isn't worried about being invaded(in comparison to Eastern European states, where Russia was a strong motivator for joining the EU).
    - II.1.a.i.c: Is both too rich(with a strong welfare system), and is already reaping the benefits of the EU without having to pay the costs.
    - II.1.a.i.d: Swiss people love direct democracy, consider it a core part of their national identity and their uniqueness, and worry about it being hampered by EU membership.
  - II.1.a.ii: Why Switzerland joined the Schengen Area.
    - II.1.a.ii.a: Strengthened the Swiss economy, from tourism, greater labor market, and manufacturing standards.
    - II.1.a.ii.b: Made it easier for Swiss citizens to travel abroad.
II.2: Case study on the UN - is it not a world government? Why not? Is it the foundation a global government could be built on?
 - II.2.a: UN in Korea, the closest that the UN came to genuinely acting as a world government.
 - II.2.b: The UN's fall from international grace and influence.

II.3: The League of Nations - why did it fail? What can its lack of adoption, and lack of 'teeth' tell us about the pitfalls that must be avoided in a global government?
 - > It must be stated that the age of nationalism, which was a major backdrop to the failure of the League of Nations, is over. We live in a globalized world, and the idea of a global government doesn't counteract the territorially expansionist(and culturally assimilative) nature of nationalism, it is a modern liberalization and globalization of the nation-state. This must be stated to counter the arguement that the League of Nations is precedent for the failure of a global government, instead of proof that a global government WOULD work due to being in a different era and a fundamentally different structure.
 - II.3.a: The necessity of sovereignty
	- II.3.a.i: The League of Nations was a voluntary organization, with no mechanism for its decisions to do anything.
 - II.3.b: The necessity of enforcement: why a supranational organization won't work, and why a true global state is necessary.
	- II.3.b.i: Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and the League of Nations' inability to do anything about it.
## III: Consideration of Economic Structures for a Global Government

III.1: What is the economic philosophy of the world government? How much intervention/interference does it have over the economy? 
 - III.1.a: Is it a free market, planned economy, or something in between? 
    - III.1.a.a: Hayek & Friedman.
    - III.1.a.b: Keynes & Rawls & Roosevelt.
		- III.1.a.c: Marx & Engels
    - III.1.a.d: Case Study on East and West Germany, and the superiority of the West German model which is still visible.
    - III.1.a.e: Case Study on South and North Korea, and the superiority of the South Korean model which is *literally* visible from space.
		- III.1.a.f: Case Study on the United States and Denmark, with the United States being a more free-market economy, and Denmark being a comparatively more planned economy(democratic socialism).

III.2: How would the numerically greater but significantly poorer areas of the world be brought up to the level of the numerically smaller but significantly richer areas of the world? 
 - III.2.a: Is a short term "wealth drain" from the wealthy areas to the poorer areas of the world, directed in some measure by the government, to dramatically speed up development to ensure long-term stability of the world government necessary? At what scale should this take place? [Must link back to III.1.a, and the economic philosophy of the world government to ensure consistency]
    - III.2.a.a: Case Study on the Marshall Plan, and how it was a success.
			- II.2.a.a.i: Caveat that the Marshall Plan was between nations, not an internal wealth transfer which is what this would be.
			- II.2.a.a.ii: Caveat that the Marshall Plan was a short-term wealth transfer, not something that was a continuous mechanism of wealth transfer.
    - III.2.a.b: How would the world government ensure that the wealth drain on the wealthy areas is not permanent, and that the poorer areas of the world are able to become self-sufficient and self-sustaining?
      - III.2.a.b.i: Case Study on the failures of foreign aid in Africa, and how the world government would have to avoid these failures.
    - III.2.a.c: If a wealth drain is necessary, what would be the highest priority/return on investment(not for businesses, but for the long-term stability of the world government) areas to invest in?
      - III.2.a.c.i: Case Study on the Post-WWII Japanese economic miracle, and where the greatest growth was relative to the investment.
 - III.2.b: How would the world government ensure that the poorer areas of the world are not exploited by the richer areas of the world, or by large conglomerates in a second "Scramble for Africa"? Is this something that can be structurally built in and prevented, or must it be policed on a case-by-case basis?
	- III.2.b.a: Case study on large oil companies in Nigeria and the Congo(and others if found in research) and how they have limited the development of the countries they are in.
	- III.2.b.b: Case study on the Banana Republics of Central America, and how they were exploited by large companies.
 - III.2.c: How would a mass flight of human capital from the poorer areas of the world to the richer areas of the world be prevented, if it should be prevented at all?  
   - III.2.c.a: Case Study on the "brain drain" from wealthy places like Ireland, and poorer nations like India to the United States.
   - III.2.c.b: Should it be prevented? 

III.3: Discussion of taxation structures, and how to balance them against huge regional differences in both income AND cost of living.
 - III.3.a: Finland vs USA vs Canada taxation and government spending.
	- III.3.a.a: High-taxation for the large government services for individual comfort, but poor industry/innovation/entrepreneurship(low social mobility as differnece between rich and poor is small in absolute terms, but tax rates go up dramatically)
	- III.3.a.b: Mid-taxation for the a smaller amount of government services for individual comfort, but a respectable industrial and innovative economic base.
	- III.3.a.c: Low-taxation for a small amount of government services for individual comfort, but a large industrial/innovative base, and a large amount of entrepreneurship(comparatively high social mobility).
 - III.3.b: A system of objectively scalable government [In it's taxation elements, it is a whole government reform plan but that goes in IV.5]
	- III.3.b.a: A progressive-flat tax, where it is a scaled bracket system based on three major percentages of income, with those brackets being relative to the cost of living and average income of the region.

III.4. What would be the benefits of the elimination of trade barriers? What percentage of global GDP is lost to the frictions of trade barriers?
 - III.4.a: Zero-sum vs positive-sum decisions, and how the elimination of trade barriers would be positive-sum for the world as a whole. 
	 - III.4.a.a: Shift from an externally competitive economy with each nation trying to out-compete each other to get the largest slice of the pie, with large companies being protected by their states, to an internally competitive economy which will increase the size of the pie for everyone and not have state protectionism of enterprises.
   - III.4.a.b: Friedman "Free to Choose".
 - III.4.b: German Zollverein, its benefits, and how it was a precursor to the even greater economic gains under German unification.
   - III.4.b.a: Quotes from "Bismarck: A Life" by Jonathan Steinberg.
   - III.4.b.b: Quotes from "The Industrial Revolutionaries" by Gavin Weightman.
 - III.4.c: European Coal and Steel Community, and how it was a precursor to the even greater economic gains under the EU.
   - III.4.c.a: Connection to II.1.a, Switzerland economic growth from its bilateral agreements with the EU.
 - III.4.d: Is this just the maximum extent of comparative advantage? Is the end state here(not the end *goal*) the maximally efficient production of goods by the locality that can produce them the most efficiently, with a highly intertwined system of trade and economic growth. 
	- Smith's "Wealth of Nations" does reference it, use the quote.
	- Ricardo's "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation" is the foundation of it, use the quote.
	- There is no case study here, but a theoretical application of an economic principle - nothing to this scale has ever been tried before. Even the most likely comparison point, the EU, has too many extentuating factors to be a good comparison point(there is wealth dispartiy between EU nations, but not as significant as the world as a whole).
	- Hayek's epistemological argument against central planning that no one person or group of people can know enough about the relevant factors of the economy as a whole or the personal desires of every individual to be able to make better decisions than the market mechanism. 


III.5: Addressing some economic problems inherent to a global nation.
  - III.5.a: How would currency devaluation be prevented? With no external currency to compare to, how would the value of the currency be determined?
    - III.5.a.a: The Roman Empire suffered heavily from this problem, but the Solidus was able to prevent this problem for a time. Historical Reference to include.
		- > Picking, designing, or planning the implementation of a currency is not in the scope of this paper, but structurally preventing currency devaluation and runaway inflation(without another currency to balance against) is.
	- III.5.b: Many of the former-nations now part of the Global Nation have suffered from endemic corruption - what would be the Global Nation's anti-corruption policy & strategy.
		- III.5.b.a: Brief discussion of the causes of corruption, and their lasting effects on the economy and society.
		- III.5.b.b: Case Study on Singapore, and how they were able to eliminate corruption(though it was done through semi-autocratic means).
## IV: Consideration of Political&Systemic Structures for a Global Government
IV.1: [RELATED TO III.2] How would the political power of the numerically greater, but significantly poorer areas of the world be balanced against the much wealthier but numerically inferior areas? 
 - IV.1.a: Should greater per-person political power according to wealth be implemented? 
 - IV.1.b: If not, how would tyranny-of-the-majority redistribution efforts be prevented? Is this something that can be fixed electorally, or is it a taxation structure?
 - IV.1.b.i: Point to new taxation structures in III.3

IV.2: Hold-outs from before the Global Nation.
 - IV.2.a: One of the preconditions was that the government structures of all the world's nations would be transferred to the Global Nation - how would a transition to new government structures be handled?
 - IV.2.b: How would national debt be handled? Would it be forgiven, or would it be transferred to the Global Nation? The Global Nation can't owe and be paid by itself, so how would this be handled?
	- IV.2.b.a: What happened to the debt of the Confederate States of America after the American Civil War? 
	- IV.2.b.c: What happened to the debt of the East German government after German reunification?
	- IV.2.b.d: Is the "price of doing business" for the creation of the Global Nation the cancelling out of all state to state debt(obviously privately held debt would not be affected in this case), or is an addition to that wealth transfer mechanism relative to indebtedness the better way to handle this[III.2.a]?
 - IV.2.c: How would patents and intellectual property be handled? If one person owns a patent in one country, and another person in another country, and they are now both a part of the Global Nation, who owns the sole rights to the patent? 
	- IV.2.c.a: I do not believe that any past example is relevant in this case, as it would the patents of EVERY country in the world being merged into a single patent/intellectual properly market.
	- IV.2.c.b: Is a grandfathered phase-out of patents the best way to handle this?

IV.3: On what bounds would lower levels of government be structured upon
 - > It has already been established by this point that it is a unitary state, not a federation or union in the sense of the European Union. Leaving is not an option. The question here is what the "provinces" of the Global Nation would be, what their powers would be, and how they would be structured. 
 - IV.3.a: Would the Global Nation be federalist, unitary, or directly controlled by the central government?
	- IV.3.a.i: Case Study on the United States, and how it follows the federalist model.
	- IV.3.a.ii: Case Study on France(find paper I wrote on France vs Israel Government Structure), and how it follows the unitary model.
	- IV.3.a.iii: The combination structure of some elements of federalism for innovations in government structure & function that can be tried on a smaller scale, some elements of unitary government for efficiency and standardization, and some elements of direct control/direct democracy for citizen buy-in and decision making.

IV.4: Inherent Problems with the Global Nation
 - IV.4.a: The Global Nation will by its nature have no outside competitor to compare itself to, and no outside force to keep it in check. How would this be handled? Are stronger institutions the answer here, or weaker ones? Is greater regional and local autonomy the answer here, or less? 
  - IV.4.b: Defeating Cardwell's Law, and how the Global Nation would have to be structured to prevent it.
    - IV.4.b.i: Cardwell's Law: "States can only be innovative/technically creative for a limited period of time, after which point they move about the pace of every other state"
    - IV.4.b.ii: How would the Global Nation be structured to prevent this? Is it possible to structurally prevent it.
      - IV.4.b.ii.a: Case Study on the United States, and how it has been able to avoid Cardwell's Law for so long.
      - IV.4.b.ii.b: Case Study on the United Kingdom, and how it was a victim of Cardwell's Law.
  - IV.4.c: The Roman Empire fell due to its lack of external competitors to unite, drive forward, and focus its efforts. How would the Global Nation avoid this fate?
		- IV.4.c.i: Case Study on the Roman Empire, and how it fell due to a lack of external competitors.
		- IV.4.c.ii: Case Study on the United States, and how it hasn't been able to avoid this fate(in large part - it can still avoid it, but is trending inward, isolationist, and protectionist).

IV.5: Structures for Citizen Participation/Government Structure.
  - IV.5.a: How would the Global Nation be structured to allow for citizen participation in government? Would it be a direct democracy, a representative democracy, or something else entirely?
    - IV.5.a.i: Tie back to Switzerland, and their implementation of direct democracy.
    - IV.5.a.ii: The United States as a general example of a representative democracy.
    - IV.5.a.iii: "Architecture of a Technodemocracy" by Jason M. Hanania, and how certain elements of techodemocracy would be a good fit for the Global Nation.
    - IV.5.a.iv: The structure of citizen participation in the Global Nation as a triad of direct democracy, representative democracy, and technodemocracy into a cohesive form, and how it interacts with a system of objectively scalable government(see III.3).

## V: Consideration of Cultural&Social Structures for a Global Government

V.1: How does the political structure of the Global Nation prevent the dominance of a single culture, or the dominance of political entity on the lines of cultural identity, while still allowing for free expression?
  - V.1.a: This question comes into play especially in the case of ethic or cultural groups starting to form political parties or entities for the sole benefit of their own group, instead of a party on ideological lines. Should this be prevented? If not, how would it be prevented from doing harm to the stability and freedom of the Global Nation while not infringing on the freedoms of the group?

V.2. How would cultural checks and balances be made to allow for free expression of individuals, whilst preventing what might be seen as gross oppression in one culture and normal in another.
 - V.2.a: This becomes a question of whether the Global Nation has a cultural relativist or universalist philosophical view, and if so, how is it enforced. 
  - V.2.a.i: For example, there is a belief from some Western Points of View that the Hijab that Muslim woman must wear is an affront to the self-determination and self-expression of that woman. How would the Global Nation handle this?
  - V.2.a.i: In another example, should a certain age be mandated to wait until before you can accept a specifically religious or cultural practice? For example, should a child in the Christian faith be able to be baptized before they have a certain number of years of life experience? If they aren't declared old enough to vote as they do not have sufficient cognitive ability to make that decision, why should they be able to join a religion? Does that not infringe on their fundamental rights of self-expression and self-determination[I.1.d]? 

### VI: Conclusion
 - VI.1: Why Give Up Sovereignty?
    - VI.1.a: Summary of Economic, Political&Systemic, and Cultural&Social benefits of a Global Nation.
      - VI.1.a.i: Back to Switzerland, they joined the Schengen Area, but not the EU. Why should they give up their sovereignty to the Global Nation? Use them as the example of a nation that despite great wealth would benefit from the Global Nation.
			- VI.1.a.ii: Back to Nigeria, an example of a poor but growing nation that would benefit from the Global Nation for their own reasons: economic growth, political stability, elimination of corruption, integration into the global economy.
			- VI.1.a.iii: Back to the United States, an example of a nation that would benefit from the Global Nation despite already being the most powerful, wealthiest, and most influential nation in the world. 
		- VI.1.b: Summary of the benefits of the Global Nation, and how it would be a net benefit for all of humanity.
