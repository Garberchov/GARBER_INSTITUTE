1. Original Prompt: Is total global integration desirable? If so, how can it be achieved. If not, why is it undesirable?  
2. Updated Content for background and definition: Total global integration for this purpose will be defined as the complete breakdown of geopolitical borders between nation-states, and the reorganization of world governments into a single entity. The exploration of how it could be achieved will NOT be a discussion of "x event happened and now the whole world wants to be one nation", this is not a discussion of the CAUSE of it - it is a discussion of the process of integration, the steps of integration world economies and breaking down borders. This will proceed into a description of what that governmental structure could look like, and the potential pitfalls in the structure's design.
3. Next Steps:
 - 3a. Sources: Wide variety of sources from magazines, and old archives of newspapers for opinion pieces on the empires of the day - in the view of how to counter the  - argument of it not just being an empire, etc. Foundational political thinkers, and their works, and works written about them. Bismarck, Hobbes, Smith, Marcus Aurelius,  - Plato, Lincoln, etc. Cultural sources: from sociological thinkers, anthropological workers, etc.
 - 3b. Sources for different purposes; Economics, borders, integrating different cultures. 
 - 3c. Data: Ourworldindata, EU, Library of Congress, State Department, UN. Ex: EU GDP change following greater levels of integration.
 - 3d. Refine terminology based on reading.
 - 3e. Benchmark: 
 - 3e-1: Provide greater clarity in the next update for prompt to better define objective goals and the scope of the paper. - Sunday, March 26.
    - Terminology: Change "total global integration" to "global governance", or "Single Global Government" - to better define the scope of the paper as political, social, and economic instead of the process of integration.
    - Objective Goals: The goal should not be to hypothesize a scenario that would LEAD to the formation of a Single Global Nation, the goal is to use historical context and political thought from a variety of sources to imagine potential pitfalls and design a system that a global government could use. Keeping in mind the practical realities of such unparalleled potential global cohesion, the social, economic, and political impacts of free trade and free movement should be examined.
 - 3e-2: Provide the FIRST submission of potential sourcing information - to include bibliographic information, a summary of content & context towards highlighting the BROAD  - thesis. - Sunday, April 2
 - 3e-3: Provide a first BROAD outline of the structure of the paper. Ex: Section 1: World today. A- geopolitical divisions etc- Sunday, April 9

Updated March 30, 2023:

I actually like "Integration" bc it keeps in mind / in check the concept of the various points we'd have to move from / incorporate to make the blending work.   The purpose (I think)  that you want to EXPLORE is GLOBAL INTEGRATION OF GEOPOLITICAL BOUNDARIES as a model for PEACEFUL, EFFICIENT, RESPECTFUL GOVERNANCE.  Something in this?? 

-=-- I don't want you to fall into the trap of devising any Utopia and backfilling with examples of why individual "states" fail compared to that model.  (IN THIS - YOUR REVISED COMMENTARY IS CORRECT/GOOD/VALID TO MOVE ON) -- " The goal should not be to hypothesize a scenario that would LEAD to the formation of a Single Global Nation, the goal is to use historical context and political thought from a variety of sources to imagine potential pitfalls and design a system that a global government could use"   

--- We want to stay away from being too simplistic or "surface" in your deep dive.  

--- In this - as you said below - requires an examination not of a place that does not (yet?) exist - but of a breakdown (*how is this accomplished) of geographic borders (CASE STUDIES -- 1 OR 2? POST-CZECHOSLOVAKIA? US / SPAIN / FRANCE 18TH/19TH CENTURY? AFRICA?), the elements that would have to exist for a single "world government" -- (HOW ARE GOVERNMENT CHARTERS CREATED? WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT LANGUAGE? HOW ARE LEADERS SELECTED? HOW IS VOTING APPORTIONED? WHAT KIND OF CASE STUDIES / RESOURCES TO PULL ON ... PHILOSOPHICAL THINKING? HOW DOES THE UN AS A MODEL -FROM ITS CREATION TO ITS CURRENT GLOBAL ROLE-- SERVE TO HELP/HINDER/SUPPORT/DETRACT FROM THE IDEA?) 

--- Similarly this for sure isn't a "Geographic, cultural & political" 3 pronged paper.    You MIGHT start VERY BROADLY with this as you start an outline draft but a lot of meat in the details here (see below) 

---- "Keeping in mind the practical realities of such unparalleled potential global cohesion, the social, economic and political impacts of free-trade and free movement should be examined."   For sure.  Do we still have cheap labor in Vietnam and what does that do (or not) to their governmental standing? 

--- Other pieces of the puzzle to consider / determine what to include... May be: 
SOCIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS:  POPULATION GROWTH/DECLINE, HEALTH & WELL BEING GEOGRAPHICALLY, DISPLACED POPULATIONS, "LESSER" RECOGNIZED CULTURAL FACTIONS AS HAVING A ROLE IN GOVERNMENT? (AMERICAN INDIANS? PUERTO RICANS!?, ROHENGA? TIBETANS?) 
FINANCES  - 
RELIGION / CULTURAL RESPECT / 
HISTORICAL PRESERVATION - doesn't where we (all) came from have a place in the future construct - how to preserve that? 

3e-2: Provide FIRST submission of potential sourcing information - to include bibliographic information, a summary of content & context towards highlighting the BROAD thesis. - Sunday April 2 **REVISED TO APRIL 10-12.  *Delays, holiday etc.) 
3e-3: Provide a first BROAD outline of the structure of the paper. Ex: Section 1: World today. A- geopolitical divisions etc- Sunday april 9  REVISED TO APRIL 19. 

Update May 16: 3e-2 and 3e-3 didn't happen due to preparation for AP tests. Both will be submitted soon.
