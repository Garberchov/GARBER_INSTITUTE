#### Continuity In A Function
 - Some functions are continuous, while some are discontinuous. There are polynomials, like f(x)=x^4 + x^3, plus so on and so forth. These are continuous paths; you can trace the entire function, the entire f(x) without lifting your finger from the paper.
 - If we look at another example, like the absolute value of x, it's the same thing. Even at x=0, you can trace the entire path without lifting your finger from the paper. So f(x)=|x| is another continuous function.
 - Let's say that f(x)=round(x). So for values of x=0.4, if I round 0.4, I get zero. If I round 1.2, I get 1. If I round 3.7, I get 4. Well here, if I graph f(x) as a function of x, I have to pick my finger up. In fact, I need to pick my finger up an infinite amount of times the further and further I go out. Because every time I go from 0.4999999 to 0.5, I need to lift my finger up. So round(x) is discontinuous. It's not a continuous function.
 - Let's look at f(x)=1/(x - 1). Now If I graph this out, I actually have an asymptote at 1. So as x approaches 1 from 0 lets say, f(x) goes to negative infinity. Well at some point, I'm going to have to lift my finger up, put it back down at positive infinity once I get to the other side of 1 (just greater than 1), and I can trace the rest of the function. So again, this is discontinuous because I have to lift my finger up from the paper.
