#### Defining Limits with Graphs
 - So a pendulum, let's say your watch (you're trying to hypnotize somebody) is swinging back and forth along a string. Now I can take a look at the location along x as a function of time, and maybe when I release it from zero, the time here is zero. The pendulum goes through and makes one swing, and on the other side the time is about 6. So if I graph the location of the pendulum and mark out the time that it's at a particular location, I might get something that looks like this:

 - As we move forward in time, we know that the location of the pendulum will follow this line, and at t = 4, we expect it to approach and reach this point. If we start at 5 seconds in, say here, we can reverse time, and if we reverse time, we see that the pendulum will approach the same point where it was at t = 4. The limit of the pendulum location is right here at t = 4.
 - I can graph that another way. If I graph the location as a function of time, my graph approaches the location at t = 4 from both the left-hand side where time is increasing and the right-hand side where time is decreasing. I could say that the limit of the position as we approach the time of 4 is here:
 - Let's look at the function |x|. The graph of |x| looks like a V, and you know that as you approach the value x = 0, f(x) will equal 0. Say f(0.1) = 0.1, f(0.01) = 0.01, f(0.001) = 0.001, f(0.00000001) is. . . well, you get the idea. If we approach it from the other side, we get the same behavior. f(-0.1) = 0.1, f(-0.01) = 0.01 and so on and so forth. In both cases, the value of this function is approaching zero as we go to x = 0.

 - What about a function that is defined piecewise? So for a piecewise function, such as f(x) = x for x less than or equal to zero, and f(x) = 1 for x greater than zero, as we approach x = 0 from the left-hand side, our function approaches the value of zero. As we approach x = 0 from the right-hand side, our function approaches the value of 1. This might be something to consider a little later on. What about the function, f(x) = 3(x)2? Well, there's a limit at, say, x = 2.
 - As we approach x = 2 from the left-hand side, f(x) goes to the value of 12. As we approach it from the right-hand side, the value of f(x) also goes to 12.

#### Understanding Limits using Notation

 - Limits in math are just like in the real world. They're what happens as you approach something. Say you want to find the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2. One way you can do it is to look at what happens to values of x as you approach 2. Let's say that at 2, f(x) is undefined. But what happens as we approach 2 from, say, the left-hand side? As we approach 2 from the left-hand side, f(x) seems to be moving toward 4. If we approach it from the right-hand side, for this particular function, it also approaches 4. So we might write that the limit of f(x) as x goes to 2 is 4.

 - You can do this for a lot of functions. For example, f(x) = 10(7 + x)^(1/3) for x does not equal 1 and f(x) = 1 when x = 1. What is the limit as this function approaches 1? Let's write this out in a horizontal table. At zero, f(x)=19.13. As we increase x, f(x) is also increasing. It looks like f(x) is approaching 20.
 - On the other side of the line, it also seems like the value of f(x) is going to be 20 at x=1. So here we would say the limit as x goes to 1 of f(x) is equal to 20.
