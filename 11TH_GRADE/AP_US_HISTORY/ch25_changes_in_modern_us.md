#### Technological Revolutions:
 - Though the digital revolution has been under way for roughly 30-50 years already, some of its ramifications are just being felt. The essence of the digital revolution is computers, such as the one on your desk, on your lap, or even in your pocket, which allow information to be stored digitally on microchips. The digital revolution has replaced many other forms of storage and filing systems; gone, for example, are the rolodexes from libraries, or the numerous filing cabinets, which used to populate every office or home. Instead, hundreds, if not thousands, of documents can now be stored on a microchip smaller than a grape.
 - More than just storing information, the digitizing of everything - from media, to phones, to television broadcasts - has changed our lives in unexpected ways and will likely continue to do so. For example, the creation of high-definition television digitized the signal in which most television stations broadcast. The resulting picture was far clearer and crisper than the previous, analog signals.
 - One of the reasons the digital revolution has progressed so far so fast is the new and evolving field of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology refers to the creation of artificial structures at the smallest sizes possible - at times even down to the atomic or molecular levels! Like the digital revolution, nanotechnology is beginning to touch every aspect of our lives. Indeed, the two trends are working in concert: advances in nanotechnology are allowing digital code to be written on smaller and smaller surfaces, causing computing power and storage space to grow exponentially in recent years.
 - Nanotechnology, however, extends into far more realms than just information technology. In the coming years, some have their hopes pinned on nanotechnology to help solve many of the world's issues. For example, recent advances in nanotechnology have allowed scientists to create solar fuel cells that are both smaller and five times more effective than current silicon-based cells. Additionally, entirely new and quickly progressing fields, like nanorobotics, hope to create microscopic machines, which can build consumer goods, be used in complicated surgeries, and even self-replicate themselves if given the correct materials!
 - The third technological revolution we'll discuss is the Internet. Again, like the digital revolution, the Internet is not solely a creation of the 21st century; in fact, the Internet was pioneered in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee - not, as you might have heard, by Al Gore. Even though the Internet was around before the 21st century, it was in the past decade and a half that the Internet has truly become a facet of everyday life. The Internet has changed our lives in unexpected ways, allowing us to have a world of information at our fingertips, allowing some people to work entirely from their own homes, and creating entirely new digital communities.
 - Two concurrent innovations - social media and the smartphone - have both made the Internet a permanent fixture in the world today. Whether it's through Facebook, Twitter, or some other social media platform, social media has made it possible for people to stay connected with friends that live in distant locations or better coordinate activities with those close by. Additionally, the smartphone, which is not just a phone but essentially a small computer, has made the Internet accessible to nearly anyone at any time. The growth of the smartphone industry and the rapidly expanding uses for the Internet has also spurred the growth of Internet infrastructure; for example, many restaurants and bars now boast of having free wireless Internet connections available for patrons' phones and laptops.

#### Social Media:
 - Social media refers to any Internet website, smartphone application, or other modern technology that allows people to connect with one another and build online communities. The breadth of this definition is vast, including groups of friends in the same city who create an online community or message board to coordinate activities better and groups of people who have never met face-to-face and are simply united due to common interests or common causes. Social media is incredibly flexible this way. In general, it allows its users to decide what the uses of its product should be. This is a huge part of why it has become so successful so quickly.
 - One of the first of these platforms - and certainly the first to gain widespread acclaim - was Facebook. Facebook was created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and several of his Harvard classmates.(Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskowitz et cetera) Originally designed as a tool to allow Harvard students to view pictures and eventually communicate with other Harvard classmates, the site expanded to other universities and was opened to the public in September 2006. It grew the fastest in these first years, having approximately 100,000 users by August 2008. By September 2012, Facebook's one billionth user had created an account. 
 - Social media, especially Twitter, is also revolutionizing journalism. News outlets, which used to only get information from a reporter on the ground, can now gather information from countless sources who update their social media accounts as events happen. For example, when protests and revolution broke out across the Arab world in 2010 and 2011 - the so-called 'Arab Spring' - the tumultuous events were documented on social media, and the world didn't have to wait for a reporter to write up a story the following day. The news was reported as it happened.
 - For all of social media's positive effects on the world, the platform also has its detractors. Twitter, for instance, has been criticized for forcing more nuanced conversation to be boiled down so as to meet the platform's 140-character limit. Facebook and social media in general is often in the news over its inability - and some would claim unwillingness - to protect users' private information, selling it to marketing firms. In other ways, psychologists and sociologists claim social media has a detrimental effect on the human psyche, as several studies have shown conclusively that using social media actually makes the user feel more inadequate or insecure about their own life.

#### 21st Century Population Migration
 - Global migrations can be caused by various reasons. Whether it's spurred by armed conflict, economic crises, or other factors, large groups of people often move for the opportunity to give themselves and their family a better life in a new country or region. In the 21st century, this rule of thumb and the demographic realities discussed above will largely dictate what the world looks like by the end of the century. For example, some of those nations with large economic sectors will require more workers than they have within their own borders, especially semi-skilled workers in the trades, in order to maintain their economic activity. For example, the government of Canada already claims to have an enormous shortage of semi-skilled laborers in trades such as mining, forestry, and plumbing. These labor gaps will likely be filled by those poorer countries with more workers than they have jobs. Richer countries, in general, will likely be forced by their need for labor to have more friendly immigration policies.
 - Furthermore, this migration of people from a poor area to a rich area is relevant on smaller, national scales as well. Since the dawn of the industrial age, people have increasingly moved from more rural, farming communities to more populated urban centers where there is more opportunity and greater wealth to be had. This trend will only continue throughout the century for many of the same reasons discussed above: people will simply continue to gravitate toward areas with greater opportunity and greater wealth. Studies have shown, after all, that when poorer populations become more mobile they tend to improve their income, education levels, and their general standard of living.
 - The increased movement of different people around the globe will inevitably create issues. Firstly, migrant workers, especially those with little or no education, are susceptible to exploitation, both by their employers and by third parties like human traffickers. In addition, migrant populations will likely face increased opposition in their new country, be it from isolationist groups who generally want to end immigration, or those worried about the increased competition for domestic jobs.
 - Additionally, as workers and families migrate around the world, there will be increased cultural friction as these groups inevitably bring their values and way of life with them. Governments which accept more and more migrant workers and families will have to do their best to protect these new immigrants from being discriminated against, both at the work place and on the streets.

 
#### Latin America
 - In the summer of 2014, the United States experienced a massive surge in immigration across the Mexican-US border. What was alarming, however, was how many of the immigrants migrating across the border were minors. The sudden and large influx of young migrants brought immigration from Latin America once again into the national spotlight. But the rise of Latin American migration to the United States is not a recent phenomenon. Whereas immigration to the United States used to be predominately European, most immigrants today to the United States come from Latin America. But what are the roots of Latin American immigration?
 - A second theory that also helps explain why migration might occur between two countries is the New Economics of Migration Theory. This theory argues that migrants don't move because of the pull of higher wages, but because of the push of ineffective markets in their home country.
 - Take, for example, a Guatemalan citizen looking to buy a home for his family. Under normal circumstances in the United States, someone would go to the bank in order to secure a mortgage toward buying a house. But in Guatemala, there may not be a strong enough banking system that he can rely on to obtain ownership of his home. In the absence of such a system, our Guatemalan citizen will have to look for other ways to raise the capital necessary to buy a home. And one of those ways available to him is to migrate towards the United States temporarily so that he can raise sufficient money to construct his home. In other words, this theory holds that migration is a temporary solution to overcome deficiencies in the markets of the immigrant's country. An important prediction of this theory is that immigration will only be temporary, not permanent, and that immigrants will remit, or send back, lots of money to their home country.
 - A third theory, called Segmented Labor Market Theory, argues that migration occurs because of the high demand of developed countries for immigrant labor. According to this theory, a service economy like the United States has two kinds of jobs: high paying jobs with great benefits and desirable conditions and low-skilled jobs that are often hazardous or unwanted. According to this theory, immigrants come to the United States because they help fulfill the unwanted and hazardous low-skilled jobs that many American citizens refuse to perform.
 - A fourth theory, called World Systems Theory, looks at international migration from a macro-level perspective. This theory argues that the rise in international migration is a result of globalization. Globalization is the process by which the world economies have become more integrated. This theory argues that as capitalism has spread worldwide, the economies of third-world countries have dramatically changed.
 - For example, prior to the arrival of capitalism in Latin America, several immigrants were peasant farmers who specialized in the cultivation of one crop within their local market. But as foreign companies have come in and taken over farming markets, several peasants have been unable to compete as peasant farmers. This push off their land has forced many migrants to seek employment either in a major Latin American urban center or migrate to a first-world economy, like the United States.
 - World Systems Theory also considers the role of political history as a cause of immigrant migration. For example, an important predictor of whether an immigrant migrates to a country is how connected the two countries are politically.
 - A fifth theory looks not so much as what causes migration to begin, but at what causes it to continue. This theory, called Social Capital Theory, examines the way in which migrant social networks transmit information about immigration back to their home country.
 - For example, take a migrant from the Dominican Republic who moves to New York City. This migrant may phone back to the Dominican Republic and relay information to friends and family about life in the United States and ways to succeed. Those who hear these stories may then use the information in order to prepare their own trip to the United States. In other words, immigrant social networks may transmit information to their hometowns which make it easier for other immigrants to arrive in the United States, thus creating a snowball effect of increasing migration from an area. Indeed, many of the migrant children who attempted to arrive in the United States during the 2014 summer had some relative already in the United States.

#### Globalization
 - In order to talk about how it is affecting world cultures, we should probably first discuss just what globalization is. Globalization can refer to many things, but generally it refers to the increased exchange of ideas, values, and culture across borders between disparate cultures and regions. Anything can be conscious or unwitting agents of this change, be it corporations, cultural trends, or actual people themselves.
 - Globalization and its effects on the world are still a hotly contested issue. Some see globalization as a natural side effect of the growth of global capitalism and a generally positive development. After all, the exchange of beliefs and values across cultures has led to some of the greatest discoveries and challenged the greatest minds in our shared history. In addition, the integration of global economic markets has spurred some of the greatest economic growth in human history.
 - When it comes to sex and gender roles, the treatment of women differs greatly from region to region. For example, in the United States or in Europe, one does not think twice about seeing a woman behind the wheel of a car. However, some countries in the world, such as Saudi Arabia, are still male-dominated societies where women are barred from driving altogether. Though this is an extreme case, it's an example of the vastly different treatment of women and women's roles which still separate various world cultures. These vast cultural differences can create considerable friction.
 - Multinational corporations are participants in globalization and cultural imperialism because they often peddle the same goods, message, and values in all their stores or locations throughout the globe. To continue with our example, even though McDonald's menu changes in their stores depending on their location, each store is still committed to the same friendly customer service and food made quickly. While McDonald's is only one company, the existence of hundreds of enormous multinational companies today makes these companies - many of them Western-based - agents of cultural imperialism as they expand their operations across borders and continents.
