#### Classic Philosophers 
 - Much of Socrates' philosophy related to human activity, as opposed to the physical universe. His views on politics are hotly debated. In Plato's famous Republic, Socrates is presented as opposing democracy, and many scholars argue Socrates favored a government in which wise philosopher-kings rule. Unfortunately for Socrates, his views were not accepted by all.
 - Arguably the most influential philosopher of all time, Plato, who lived from the 420s to the 340s B.C.E., was a pupil of Socrates and was concerned with understanding the true, objective nature of reality, a branch of philosophy called metaphysics. It has been said by prominent scholar Alfred North Whitehead that the whole of Western philosophy consists of 'footnotes to Plato.' Plato is known for developing the Theory of Forms, in which he argues the true 'essence,' or form, of material objects exists in another non-material realm. His most famous work is his Republic. Plato's Republic is a Socratic dialogue concerning issues of politics, justice, and the role of philosophy. In Republic, Plato seems to suggest the ideal society is one ruled by just philosopher-kings, as opposed to a democracy.
 - In regard to politics, Aristotle conceived of the city as being the natural political entity and the center of political activity. The purpose of the city was to enable citizens to lead a good, fulfilling life.
 - Cicero, who lived from 106 B.C. to 43 B.C.E., was not a Greek philosopher. He was a Roman and is primarily known not as philosopher, but as an orator and politician. Cicero warned that indulgence, greed, and selfishness would lead to the destruction of Rome. He viewed the Roman Republic as the ideal political institution and believed it could only be preserved through the virtue of its people. Cicero wrote volumes, and his work was particularly influential among Renaissance thinkers. When political chaos and civil war swept Rome, Cicero found himself the enemy of Mark Antony, and under the orders of Mark Antony was executed. While not a formal member of the school, Cicero was a highly influential Roman Stoic philosopher and made heavy use of their philosophy and ethics in his arguments.

#### The Political Philosophy of the Republic by Plato
 - One of Plato's most famous works, which can be attributed to the lessons he learned from Socrates, was The Republic. This is also considered to be the first book on political science or government and uses the Platonic method to reason through ideas on justice. In the book, a group decides to create an imaginary city to define what justice looks like. The city is divided into classes: the Rulers who have an understanding of right and wrong, the Guardians who protect the city and care for its people, and the Producers who provide goods and services for the people.
 - As the men banter, they begin to discuss the meaning of justice, and what it means to be just, like being honest and following the law. Socrates takes each idea apart and this sets the theme for the rest of the book. The primary questions the men try to answer are what justice is, and does it make someone happier if they are just?
 - In Book Two, Glaucon attempts to define the good. He goes on to explain that good can be organized into three categories:
    - Good for the sake of being good
    - Good for the sake of being good and because people get something out of it
    - Good only because people get something out of it
 - Socrates introduces the idea that they should first define a just city, and this will help them to then define a just individual. The group then begins to argue for what makes a city just, and they imagine the ideal city and what it would look like and how it would function.
 - Book Three involves a discussion about the Guardians, who Socrates calls the 'heroes of the city.' This conversation evolves into one about the education of the Guardians by elder men in the city, and the group argues about what Guardians must be taught to want to protect a city.
 - In Book Four, Socrates finally gives his answer to what constitutes a just society:
     - A city that doesn't use money so that there is no poverty or rich,
     - A city that has the wisest Rulers uncorrupted by wealth, and
     - A city with the best Guardians who value their education more than anything else
 - Book Five is a deeper discussion, where the social constructs of the city are broken down. Socrates believes women should belong to the Guardian class as well and should receive the same education. He also thinks sex should be regulated so the best breeds with the best.
 - In Book Six, Socrates tries to convince the others that philosophers are wise and just in that they search for the truth as a way of life. However, Adeimantus argues that most philosophers are not like this and, in reality, are useless in that they hold ideas that are opposed to popular traditional beliefs. Socrates counters that all a city needs to be just is a Ruler who is also a philosopher or a philosopher King, being that they are of the right mind and soul, always searching for truth.

#### Aristotle's Impact
 - For many, Aristotle's writings and teachings are the foundation of modern political science. What are the exact purposes of politics and government? What are the moral duties of the state? What is the ideal relationship between government and citizens? Aristotle was amongst the first to really address these questions in a practical, logical manner, and to describe the state as existing to nurture human morality.
 - Aristotle's theories were the foundation for moral and political debates in Western philosophy, and they influenced scholars from ancient Rome to the medieval Catholic Europe and Islamic Middle East. Our modern ideas about government have evolved from this to include the idea that governments exist to protect us and our liberties. Still Aristotle's writings continue to be amongst the most studied and cited texts in human history. This is especially impressive considering that less than a third of his estimated writings have survived, and those that did are mostly lecture notes. So, it's no surprise that medieval Muslim scholars called him the 'first teacher,' or that Cicero referred to his works as a 'river of gold.' Aristotle was, quite simply, 'The Philosopher.'
 - Aristotle's impact is unquestionable and significant, but there are aspects of his thinking that have reinforced some of the darker practices in human society. While he helped produce one of the earliest taxonomies of plants and animals, Aristotle also sought to categorize human beings. In his book titled 'Politics', Aristotle described how some individuals are natural slaves, which was later used by anti-Abolitionists to justify continuing slavery in the United States prior to the Civil War. Aristotle's position on natural hierarchies existing in human society has been used to reinforce systems like feudalism with serfs, castes systems, as well as the race-based slavery of the United States.

#### Jen, Li & Confucianism 
 - In very simple terms, Jen, sometimes spelled Ren, can be translated as 'goodness' or 'humaneness.' In Confucianism, Jen is seen as a very inward and personal attribute. It does not connote right action; it deals with inward thoughts. Being inwardly oriented, it's also characterized as truly desiring only good for others. In short, it's an attitude of the heart.
 - So important is Jen that all other virtues spring from it. It should be the preeminent funnel for all human behavior and actions. In fact, Confucianism teaches that one should be willing to give his own life in order to protect Jen. In addition, it relates to all of mankind. It knows no boundaries of race or religion.
 - With this we come to the principle of Li. Differing from Jen, Li deals with one's outward social behavior. Translated as both 'propriety' and 'ritual,' Li is sometimes thought of as the working out of Jen in one's life. To use some rather common western phrasing, Li is sort of like giving feet to Jen.
 - Because Li deals with outward behavior, it deals with accepted etiquette, customs and even morality. With this in mind, its main focus seems to be on human relationships. In its ideal sense, a person honoring Li will be perfect in all his relationships. This working out of Li is especially important in what Confucianism holds as the Five Key Relationships; they are the relationship of ruler to subject, father to son, husband to wife, elder to younger and friend to friend.
 - With such a great focus on the inward heart and outward behavior, Confucianism is full of ritual. In fact, so important is ritual that many scholars refer to Confucianism as the Ritual Religion. The most important of these rituals is that of Filial Piety, or deep respect of one's elders, sometimes even called ancestor worship. In this practice, sacrifices are very regularly made to one's deceased relatives in order to not only commemorate them, but also to communicate with them and care for them. In doing this, the principles of Jen and Li continue even after death.

#### Political Thinkers of the Enlightenment
 - The Enlightenment was a philosophical movement from roughly 1650 to roughly 1780 that stressed reason and individualism over the values of tradition. This period was defined by a prominent intellectual culture, supported by the spread of printing technology. The thinkers of the Enlightenment gathered in coffee houses and other public places to debate and discuss their theories about government, science, and morality.
 - One of the first major political thinkers of the Enlightenment was Ren√© Descartes, a French philosopher in the 17th century. Like many enlightened thinkers, he was an accomplished mathematician and scientist, relying on scientific experiments to produce accurate data about the world. In philosophy, Descartes helped establish the idea of rationalism, which is the idea that truths are found through logic and intellectual reasoning.
 - Descartes laid several foundational principles through his books Discourse on the Method and Principles of Philosophy, but perhaps his most famous is this: 'I think, therefore I am.' This is one of the founding principles of Western philosophy that means, in essence, that the ability to question our existence proves that both thought and existence are real. Existence is the most basic truth, upon which all other truths can be built.
 - Another major thinker of the time was John Locke, an English philosopher of the 17th century. Locke was much more focused on political philosophy, especially the nature of the relationship between the government and the people. Locke examined the social contract, an Enlightenment theory that individuals create government by agreeing to give up some freedoms in exchange for the protection of other freedoms.
 - In the 18th century, the French philosopher Francois-Marie Arouet rose to prominence under the pen name Voltaire. Voltaire became one of the most versatile writers of his day, composing works of history, fiction, poetry, and satire. He used his pen to advocate for the individual rights that enlightened thinkers promoted. Most notably, these included the freedom of religion and freedom of speech.
 - Another 18th century philosopher was the German writer Immanuel Kant. Kant stressed the individualism of the Enlightenment in political terms, focusing on individual rights. To Kant, the way to create lasting peace was to restructure governments as constitutional republics, where elected officials govern over a nation within the legal powers given by a constitution. To Kant, this system protected the rights of the people above all else and secured global, lasting peace. 
 - In keeping with those values of individual rights, the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith brought economics into enlightened philosophy. Smith was a major proponent of free markets and laissez-faire economics, which means 'to leave,' or more to the point, very little government regulation. In essence, the government keeps its hands off. Smith also proposed the idea that the efforts of individuals to help themselves often end up helping society, referred to as the idea of the invisible hand. Both of these policies display his belief that the government needed to give the people more freedom and less regulation. He was also great friends with David Hume, who was vocally anti-religion and pro individual rights.
