### Philosophy and Social Justice

#### Plato and Aristotle
 - In his text, The Republic, Plato explores how to create a more just society. For Plato, justice is a condition of the soul, a virtue. To him, justice wasn't necessarily a framework that we use to create laws that are fair. For Plato, justice was something that came largely from the inside of a person. If you were a just person, you could help create a just society.
 - What would motivate a person to live justly, as he describes? Plato considered the virtue of justice to be a key part of living the good life. If you imagine Plato coming up with a list of the essentials for livin' large, justice would definitely be one of his responses. In his ideal society, philosopher kings would rule, preventing an emotional populace from having too much control.
 - Hmmm, sounds something like a certain Roman Emperor. Perhaps named:[Marcus Aurelius](Writing/marcus_aurelius.md)
 - Well, Plato thought that a monarch acting in the best interests of everyone was much better than citizens who are acting on their own private whims. He was concerned too about division within societies, and so part of his hope was that private property and family would be held in common. Instead of my family and my things, a society would be one big family without the need to own our own things.
 - Even among classes of people, like craftsmen, warriors, and rulers, he proposed that there are appropriate divisions and responsibilities for each to keep the society harmonious and just. Doesn't sound particularly equal, right? Though not necessarily progressive to our modern ears, The Republic is still considered by many to be an important exploration into Plato's beliefs about the ideal society.
 - Portions of Aristotle's Politics also strike us as less than just. For instance, he promoted the existing view that men were more natural leaders than women. He also found a way to justify the slavery of his time. These are both topics we would find in opposition to our current understanding of justice and equal rights.
 - He didn't view a philosopher king as the ideal solution like Plato did. Instead, he outlined various true forms of government. According to Aristotle, the true forms of government are those in which the one, or the few, or the many, govern with a view to the common interest. He was opposed to governments that rule based on private interest or the accumulation of wealth. He believed that the true forms of government could deteriorate into less just forms of government if rulers didn't govern with the common interest in mind.
 - He disagreed with Plato about issues such as eliminating the family unit and private property. Still, he did not believe that justice is about everyone getting what they want. Instead, he wanted a society where everyone gets what they deserve. He believed that virtuous behavior deserves reward and wrongdoing deserves punishment. That may sound more familiar, since our current system of court justice uses this approach to punishment.

#### Marx and Engels
 - In the middle of the 19th century, a group of socialist reformers known as the Communist League convened in London. Seeing the impoverished working class created by the Industrial Revolution, these reformers called for change. In order to summarize their beliefs, they charged two German philosophers with special interests in the economy, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, to write a mission statement of sorts on their behalf. Little did they know, they were witnessing the birth of one of the most famous political ideologies of all time - Marxism and its Communist Manifesto.
 - Both Marx and Engels were opposed to the abuses of their industrialized society. To them, the Industrial Revolution was to blame for the oppression of the working-class poor who lived in slums and faced dangerous working conditions. Making matters worse, while the poor suffered, the wealthy thrived. Marx and Engels felt this exploitation of the poor was the basis for all social and political conflict. The only way to end this conflict was through social-class revolution and the abolishment of private property. This belief, which has come to be known as Marxism, would be touted by Marx's and Engels' followers for years to come.
 - In order to end this travesty of social justice, where the rich got richer while the poor got poorer, the Communist Manifesto declared that it is inevitable that the working-class proletariat will rise up in revolution against the property-owning bourgeoisie. However, unlike most revolutions where the rebels win and take over the wealth and political power of those ousted, the Communist Manifesto also declared that the victorious proletariat should abstain from this temptation. Instead, they must use their new power to abolish, not keep, all private property. This would completely level the playing field, therefore ridding society of the evils of social class. Only in doing this would conflict end and society stabilize. 
 
#### John Rawls
 - John Rawls was an American philosopher who focused his attention on the political domain of society in his work, A Theory of Justice. Like other philosophers before him, he considers the concept of a social contract, an agreement among people to live under a system of government. In particular, Rawls emphasized justice as fairness.
 -  In his thought experiment, you would imagine that you have a representative that will meet with the representatives of every other citizen in a society to come up with principles of justice.
 - This meeting is not a literal election or vote like in our example earlier about the tax structure. Rawls meant these representatives in the thought experiment to be hypothetical only and not a situation that would happen in real life.
 - There's something very unique about this particular imaginary gathering. Those who are involved in this get-together are part of what Rawls describes as the original position, or an impartial point of view used to establish the principles of justice.
 - What makes the original position of the participants so impartial and fair? Well, they've been given a strange characteristic. Each citizen's representative knows nothing about the actual social or economic standing of the person they are representing. They don't know your income, or whether you are the wealthy business owner, or the lower-income parent, for instance.
 - They don't know your ethnicity, your gender, or your age, either. They don't even know what political or economic situation has been established in your society. This lack of information about the relative situation of those they represent is called the veil of ignorance.
 - What do they know? They know you have a certain plan for life. They know you have an interest in having enough for yourself. They also know that not everyone in the society will get everything they want. Although resources are adequate for the society in our thought experiment, resources are not infinite. Part of developing principles of justice is considering how to share these resources fairly.
 - Rawls argued that using this thought experiment highlights the importance of equal basic rights and access to opportunities like employment and education to help each person compete in the world. After all, if you don't know what your status is in society, you would want to be sure to create a political system that did not penalize or favor one group over another out of the gate.
