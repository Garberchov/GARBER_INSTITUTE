### Ethics

#### Values, Morals, and Ethics
 - Morals are understood as the ways people should act or how they believe they should act. Morality can be either descriptive or prescriptive, depending on how one approaches the topic. Descriptive morality is focused on describing how people believe they should behave, without necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with their actions. Prescriptive morality, on the other hand, is focused on prescribing how a person should behave.
 - Outside of the academic field of philosophy there are other ways of describing ethics and morals. What most approaches have in common, however, is that they take an interest in our values, or aspects of life that we consider important and worthwhile. The field of ethics acknowledges tough moral decisions and aims to understand them better.

#### Euthyphro & Plato's Ethics
 - Euthyphro is a dialogue written by Plato describing a man being prosecuted for causing another man's death. In the dialogue, Socrates has a conversation with Euthyphro's son who is prosecuting his father to determine what the man sees as virtuous and pious.
 - In his writings on ethics, Plato could have looked at this topic from a variety of angles. He could have focused on the positive and negative consequences of a person's actions, such as what impact Euthyphro's prosecution would have on his family. Or, he could have focused on whether a particular action follows the rules or not, such as the question of whether his father violated a law. These are some approaches of other philosophers.
 - But, these were not Plato's main interests; Plato was eager instead to consider, what actions are most beneficial for the human soul? As a result, Plato is known for his focus on virtue ethics, an approach to ethics that places emphasis on one's moral character.
 - The Greek word aretê can be used to describe the kind of excellence and virtues that Plato saw as so important(the word has a much larger meaning than can be readily translated into English, but in this context it mostly means "Excellence of Character"). But, why live a life of aretê, a life of virtue and excellence? Well, Plato views human life as an opportunity to aim for eudaimonia, translated as human well-being, happiness, or flourishing. 
 - According to Plato, well-being, or eudaimonia, is our highest aim as human beings, and virtue, or aretê, is our way to achieve this. In other words, the best way to live life is in pursuit of virtue. As a result, Plato's text Euthyphro has Socrates repeatedly coming back to the topic of how precisely to define what is pious and virtuous.

#### Aristotle's Ethics
 - Aristotle, quite logically, believed that life as a philosopher was the best life. The two fields that seem the most opposite to that, Politics and Gluttony were not reviled by him however but rather were seen as important by themselves. 
 - Like others before him, such as Socrates and Plato, Aristotle was a Greek philosopher who was interested in the best way to live a good life and to cultivate virtue. In particular, he believed virtue to be something that a person not only needs to understand but that a person also needs to live out in their actual lives.
 - He didn't view ethics as a purely intellectual pursuit to understand what it means to live a better life. Instead, an understanding of ethics is both intellectual and also a way to actually become better. Aristotle aimed for ethics to be both an intellectual and a practical pursuit, with the ultimate goal of human well-being and happiness.
 - Aristotle believed that being raised with a focus on the development of virtue was important, and considering that one of his students was Alexander the Great, it's hard to object to his approach.
 - When we do something that others would view as immoral or unethical, such as taking money that's not ours, we expect that some type of blame would be placed on us when others find out. Likewise, if we do something especially virtuous, such as risking our life to save another's, we might expect praise for this. Our moral responsibility for a particular action, therefore, is the blame or praise that our actions deserve. For Aristotle, a person only deserves blame or praise for their actions when they're acting voluntarily. His two conditions for this consideration are whether the person is acting freely, and whether the person is aware of what they're doing - these two are the basis of intent in criminal law.
 - Spending one's life focused on questions of what actions are worthy of blame or praise might sound bland at first. Yet, Aristotle was ultimately aiming to understand what is the purpose of our lives and how to be the best version of what we are capable of becoming. This led to his belief that Philosophy was the best basis of life, but he also knew that a society of ONLY philosophers wouldn't last very long - so he noted that politics was also important for the health of the community. 
 - Similar to this, pleasure isn't something that is inherently bad - in Aristotle's view, if it was associated with something positive, it could just be. If a great conversation with a friend gave you pleasure, why would you not want to have that conversation?
 - He also notes that a political life is also important to the health of the community. If no one engages in political debates and investigation, how will cities get created that help human beings in developing good habits? Who will create opportunities and provide resources to help people understand the purpose of their lives? So, not only does pleasure have a place, but politics do as well.

#### Meditations by Marcus Aurelius | Stoicism
 - "Meditations" is a collection of notes that Marcus Aurelius, the emperor of Rome, wrote to himself. In fact, no one really knows where the term "Meditations" comes from - the original work was titled Ta eis Heauton, which means "To Himself" and is probably a better title for the work.
 - Marcus Aurelius was a busy man, but every day he made time to write in a journal that survives to us today as a guide on how to live a balanced life from a man who dealt with challenges far beyond what most of us will ever face.
 - If you asked Marcus if he was a "Stoic" it is more likely that he would respond that he was just a student of philosophy, not indebted to any specific school. However, he did have a strong interest in Stoicism from a young age and was influenced greatly by the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, and his teacher and mentor, the Stoic philosopher Junius Rusticus.
 - In modern times, "stoic" is used to describe someone with few emotions and superhuman self control - but this is not what the Stoic school set out for. On the contrary, they believed that natural emotions were more than acceptable: they were undeniable and healthy. However they believed that the emotions should be controlled and dissected such that those built on false judgement and irrational beliefs could not be allowed to control the person.
 - While a Stoic(uppercase, as in the school) would appear to be a poor friend, who would not be able to empathize with you this is not the case. The Stoics believed that they were membered of a community, a cosmic community, (frequently referred to as a Cosmopolis, and the root of the word "cosmopolitan") and that there was a base love of other humans built into every person. 
 - In Stoicism, Virtue is defined as the ability to act in accordance with Nature, or more specifically the Logos, the order and reason of the universe. This is not to be confused with THE four stoic VIRTUES, which are Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Temperance. Any action can and should be derived from these four virtues, and any action that is not is not virtuous.
 - To a Stoic, the base human kindness that exists in all of us is diverted and corrupted by irrational passions that push us away from the Logos. They weren't trying to be emotionless, passionless robots, but rather to enjoy the things they had but not be controlled by them. Seneca, a Stoic philosopher and advisor to Nero, widely considered one of the worst Emperors of Rome, was one of the richest men in Rome but he was not controlled by his wealth. He was able to enjoy it, but frequently lived in poverty of his own choosing to prove to himself that he was not controlled by it.
 - For a Stoic, it doesn't make sense to overindulge in pleasures or complain too long about pain. These are not significant elements of life compared with the happiness that can result from living virtuously. Today, you can still see the legacy of stoic philosophy in our culture. A phrase like 'it's no use crying over spilled milk' reminds us that it's ultimately not helpful to focus on circumstances you cannot change or events that are minor in the grand scheme of things.

#### Divine Command Theory
 - Belief in God could be viewed as a belief about the very nature of the universe and the nature of morality and existence itself.
 - So, how would a theist view morality? Divine command theory is an approach to ethics that views God as the source of moral laws. You can remember the name by thinking of how 'divine' refers to 'God' and 'command' refers to 'laws': divine commands are God's laws.
 - The approach taken by divine command theorists is not about proving without a doubt that God exists. Instead, they argue that a person does not have to believe in god in order to behave morally, in such that the divine comamnds exist but people can follow them due to their own reasoning.

#### Thomas Hobbes
 - Thomas Hobbes also saw natural law in this light but with a bit of a twist. While Saints Augustine and Aquinas had thought of natural law as fixed and unchanging, Hobbes saw this differently.
 - Hobbes agreed that morality is what we can observe through reason, but he also thought it may change over time. He took a descriptive approach to natural law, meaning that he observed what morality appears to be in the present and past without insisting this would be the same throughout time. You can remember the term 'descriptive' by thinking about how Hobbes was willing to describe what he saw in different time periods.
 - This contrasted with the prescriptive view of Augustine and Aquinas, who also thought that morality is what we can observe through reason. But in their view, natural law involves the unchanging, fixed rules that continue throughout time. You can remember the term 'prescriptive' because of how they felt that this moral code was prescribed and inflexible.
 - In the view of Augustine and Aquinas, in this state of unlawfulness, natural law is still the same as far as what is right and wrong. Following God's law means behaving in the same ways that you would in a lawful society because natural law is unchanging across time and situation. Just like all human beings eat food and digest it, natural law is a set of moral rules that operate consistently and without variation.
 - In Hobbes' point of view, on the other hand, the moral code can depend on the circumstances. If there's no human law in place, and you have to defend yourself by hitting someone with a baseball bat to stay alive, this is not an unreasonable thing to do. Why? Hobbes argues that it's easy to see that an important aspect of human life - a fundamental good - is self-preservation.

#### Immanuel Kant
 - To Kant, saying to yourself 'I should watch this video, so I can learn the information' is an example of a hypothetical imperative. This means it's a statement about what a person would need to do to achieve a desired aim. You have a reason you want to learn this information. This compels you to take action and watch it because it gets you something you want.
 - But according to Kant, there are some 'shoulds' that are for everyone. These moral rules don't just apply to you if you desire a certain result, like being a singer or taking college classes. They are rules that apply to us simply because we are born.
 - These are examples of a categorical imperative, or a statement about what a person needs to do because it is a rational moral obligation. Remember the phrase 'categorical imperatives' by thinking of how the word 'categorical' means 'absolute.' These rules are universal.
 - Kant finds the categorical imperative through multiple formulations. The first two are the most well-known and the two that Kant wrote the most about. The first formulation is: 'I should never act in such a way, that I could not will that my maxim should be universal law'
 - The first formulation addresses the duties that we have to ourselves versus the duties we have to other people. For example, let's say you really need a loan to pay for a necessary medical procedure for your child, but to get the loan, you'd have to lie on your loan application. Is the maxim, or reason, for your lie moral? Kant would say no, because if everyone did what you did and lied to secure a loan, the whole lending system would fall apart, and the maxim would then become impossible. In other words, your maxim cannot be universalized.
 - The second formulation says: 'Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an end'.
 - The second formulation address the duties we have to other people, not to treat them as objects but as ends in themselves with inherent value.
 - Kant's reasoning has been challenged my numerous critics throughout the years, including French philosopher Benjamin Constant, who challenged Kant's view that it is always wrong to lie and that no maxim for lying can pass the universalization test. Constant presented a scenario known as the 'The Inquiring Murderer'.
 - In this scenario, there is someone who is intent on killing your friend. You hide your friend in your home. When the would-be murderer knocks on your door and asks if your friend is in your house, you could lie or tell the truth. Your maxim of lying is to protect your friend, but your duty is to tell the truth.
