1. Original Prompt: Is total global integration desirable? If so, how can it be achieved. If not, why is it undesirable?  
2. Updated Content for background and definition: Total global integration for this purpose will be defined as the complete breakdown of geopolitical borders between nation-states, and the reorganization of world governments into a single entity. The exploration of how it could be achieved will NOT be a discussion of "x event happened and now the whole world wants to be one nation", this is not a discussion of the CAUSE of it - it is a discussion of the process of integration, the steps of integration world economies and breaking down borders. This will proceed into a description of what that governmental structure could look like, and the potential pitfalls in the structure's design.
