### Indepdent Study on The Structure and Effects of the Global Integration of Geopolitical Boundaries 

#### Premise, preconditions, and preliminary questions to be answered:
 - The world is becoming more and more globalized, and intertwined internationally through trade, communication, and travel.
 - This paper is not about the political, economic, or military causes of the creation of a singular global nation, ecompassing all of the world's people, but rather the effects of this and to suggest a potential structure for this global nation.
 - Basic preconditions for this exploration are that in the process of this happening, no disaster occurs that would dramatically affect the world's population(nuclear war, etc.), and that the people of the world do genuinely desire a democratic, peaceful, and unified world(I do not think that this is hard to believe, though I do think that many leaders oppose this simply for their own reason.).
 - Questions to be answered include: 
  1. What kind of economic growth would be a direct effect of no tarrifs, or economic barriers between peoples. 
	2. How would a political structure allow for multiculturalism without implicitly adopting the cultural norms of a dominant political group.
	3. What kind of democratic political structure would best fit such an expansive nation, with wide disparities in income, cultural norms, and stability.
	4. How would this poltiical system balance the political power of extremely wealthy, but comparatively small populations of Europe and North America with the far less wealthy, though extremely populus regions of Asia, South America and Africa.
	5. How would this political system ensure rapid development of the less developed regions of the world, while not allowing the more developed regions to stagnate or have their resources drained for the effort.
	6. How would the holdouts of previous legal systems, intellectual property laws, and other highly specific things dependent on previous political entities that no longer exist be equitably integrated into the new system without causing massive economic and political disruption.
	7. How would the debts of previous political entities be handled, espicially when the debt is owed from a political entity that no longer exists to another political entity that no longer exists.
