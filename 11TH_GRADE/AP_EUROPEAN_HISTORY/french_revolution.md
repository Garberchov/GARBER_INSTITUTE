### The French Revolution

#### Phases of the French Revolution
 - The triggering event for such a revolution occurred in May of 1789 when King Louis XVI called an assembly of the Estates General. The king was almost bankrupt, and he could only receive more money by meeting with the three estates: the nobles, the clergy, and the Third Estate, or commoners. The members of the Third Estate, however, were fed up with the conditions in France. They wanted change, and they wanted it right away. The assembly gave them the perfect opportunity to push for reform, and before long, the French Revolution began.
 - The revolution commenced with a so-called moderate phase, at least by comparison with what would happen later. The members of the Third Estate had created so much ruckus that they had been barred from the assembly, but they were not ready to give up. Instead, they met on the tennis court at Versailles on June 20, 1789, took an oath not to disband until they got a new constitution, and eventually formed themselves into the National Constituent Assembly.
 - Meanwhile, public unrest was growing in Paris, and it overflowed when a mob stormed the Bastille prison on July 14. Paris descended into panic as the Bastille's commander and the city's mayor were beheaded.
 - The defiant National Constituent Assembly used this unrest to their advantage and obtained its new constitution as well as limitations on the monarchy and the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which proclaimed freedom, natural rights, and government by the people. The Assembly, however, still could not solve the country's economy problems, and conditions continued to deteriorate. Suspicions rose on all sides, especially against the nobility. The king became a prisoner in his own nation, violent uprisings rocked the countryside, and France entered into a war with Austria and Prussia. An elected Legislative Assembly took control of the government in 1791 but didn't do any better than its predecessor. The situation was about to explode.
 - On August 10, 1792, the Legislative Assembly fell to mob violence, and soon the new National Convention took its place. The Convention was far more radical than the Assembly, and on September 21, it abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. To emphasize that the monarchy was really defunct, the Convention executed Louis XVI in January of 1793.
 - Radical leaders like Maximilien de Robespierre and Georges Danton rose to take power. Under their control, France entered a period of radical secularism. The Convention closed Christian churches, set up a new calendar, and opened temples to the 'goddess of reason.' In March of 1793, the Reign of Terror began when the dictatorial Committee of Public Safety, which had more control over France than the Convention, started executing so-called 'traitors' - in other words, anyone who disagreed with the new regime. Over the next ten months, thousands of people fell to the guillotine.
 - This new constitution created the Directory, a five-man executive board of dictators. The terror abated a bit, but the Directory proved to be weak and unpopular. Uprisings and attempted coups broke out everywhere, and the army had its hands full trying to control them as well as fight a strenuous war against Austria, Great Britain, Russia, and Turkey.
 - The Directory had to rely completely on the military to keep order, but that backfired. On November 9, 1799, a popular, young officer named Napoleon Bonaparte carried out a successful coup d'état, which overthrew the Directory and landed Napoleon in the new executive position of consul. 

#### The Ancien Regime
 - French society in the Ancien Regime was divided into a hierarchy, or ladder, of several distinct social classes. On the top rung, we find the king, who claimed to rule the country absolutely by divine right, or the will of God. All the people of France were his subjects, and he held the power of law in his person. At least, he thought he did. In actuality, the king relied quite a lot on the support of the nobility and France's governmental structures. On the eve of the Revolution, Louis XVI of the Bourbon dynasty was France's reigning monarch.
 - Next came the First Estate - the Catholic Church. France was a Catholic country to the core, and the Church was in charge of the nation's religious life as well as charitable works, education, and record keeping. The Church, which was exempt from taxation, was very wealthy, and some people within the Church became corrupt. The higher clergy, like bishops and archbishops, were often advisers to the king and held an abundance of political power. Lower clergy, like parish priests, were more involved in the lives of the common people, and they could better identify with the sufferings and struggles of the lower classes.
 - As we move down the ladder just a little bit, we find the Second Estate - the nobility. Nobles were people with hereditary titles like duke, count, viscount, baron, and chevalier. Some noble families came from a military background, stretching back to the days of the medieval knights. Others held top positions in government. Still others had once been commoners and purchased their titles with wealth they had earned through commerce. Most nobles were land owners with large estates, and many were very wealthy. They lived in luxury with the best of everything, from clothing to art to entertainment. As a whole, the nobility was a privileged class that exercised significant power, but avoided taxation.
 - On the bottom of the ladder, we find the Third Estate - the common people. While this class made up about 96% of the population, even it was divided. The bourgeoisie were the wealthier commoners, who were involved in business or other professions. They had some money and could sometimes purchase a noble rank or a lower-level governmental office. They often resented higher classes and especially the burdensome taxation that fell heavily on them.
 - Below all of these were the peasants, who made up the vast majority of the population. They were the poorest of the population, and lived in continual poverty - despite that, they were heavily taxed.
 - These classes interacted with each other through France's various social and political structures. For example, some nobles and peasants participated in the seigneurial system. Noble seigneurs owned large estates on which peasants worked. Each peasant received the use of a section of land in return for rent and labor. On top of that, the seigneurs often taxed the peasants heavily, expecting them to pay for necessary services, like flour mills and communal bake ovens. The seigneurs also held courts to pass judgment on troublesome peasants.
 - On a larger scale, France was divided into 37 provinces, each with a local government that was in charge of enforcing laws, collecting taxes, and managing daily life. Most office holders in these local governments were nobles or wealthy bourgeois. Thirteen parlements also served France as supreme courts that registered and enacted royal decrees.
 - On the eve of the French Revolution, France was a mess. The Ancien Regime was falling apart from the inside out as years of governmental mismanagement, class resentments, war, debt, taxation, and bad harvests took their toll. In the century before 1789, France had been involved in wars with England, wars on the European continent, and wars in America. These conflicts racked up some major debt. By 1780, in fact, half of the nation's budget only just met the interest payments on its loans.
 - Taxation became heavier and heavier and heavier, especially on the Third Estate, most of whom could not afford to pay all the new taxes government officials thought up. There were taxes on each family, duties on various products, poll taxes, and special taxes to meet specific needs. The Third Estate bore the brunt of them while the First and Second Estates were mostly exempt. On top of everything, the church required a tithe, or 10% payment, from its members. Resentment among the lower classes grew quickly, especially when they saw the king, nobles, and some churchmen living in luxury.

#### Marie Antoinette
 - Maria Antonia Josepha Joanna, better known as Marie Antoinette, was born November 2, 1755, to Maria Theresa, the empress of Austria, and François I, the Holy Roman Emperor. As a member of the royal Hapsburg family, the little princess led a carefree life surrounded by luxury. She was educated, as most royal girls of her day, with an emphasis on religion and morality more than academic achievement. When Marie was 10 years old in 1765, her mother arranged for her marriage to 11-year-old Louis Auguste, the grandson of French King Louis XV. Maria Theresa was seeking a political alliance that would end the rivalry between the Hapsburgs and the French Bourbon dynasty once and for all, and she didn't hesitate to involve her young daughter in the plan.

 - On August 10, 1792, an angry mob stormed Tuileries. The French Revolution had entered into its radical Reign of Terror, and people were being beheaded right and left. The royal family ended up as prisoners in the Temple Tower, but most people didn't even acknowledge them as royalty anymore. France's National Convention had abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. French leaders were clamoring for the king's execution, and Louis XVI met his fate on the guillotine on January 21, 1793.
 - Marie was confined to a dark dungeon six weeks later, and after a two-day trial on trumped up charges of treason, adultery, and even incest, she was found guilty and sentenced to death. In reality, French leaders viewed the queen as a liability that needed to be eliminated. Marie faced her death bravely, saying, 'I am calm as people are whose conscience is clear.' On October 16, 1793, Marie Antoinette was led to the guillotine.

#### Assembly of Notables and the Estates General
 - The king turned to his finance minister, Charles de Calonne, to come up with a plan to fight the finanical cricsis. Calonne could see only one solution to France's financial crisis: tax the nobles, especially on their land holdings. Louis XVI agreed. The nobles, represented by the 13 parlements, or supreme courts, definitely did not. The king decided to gather the nobility together to explain to them why they would have to pay more taxes, and the best way he could do this was to call an Assembly of Notables.
 - The 144 members of the Assembly of Notables met for the first time in February of 1787. Most of the members were nobles, so they were annoyed by Calonne's financial presentation. Calonne offered the Assembly a choice. They could either agree to impose new taxes on the nobility or consent to force the nobles to give up their exempt status and pay the taxes currently in place.
 = Predictably, the Assembly refused both options and insisted that the government could not raise taxes or change the system at all without the approval of the Estates General, an assembly of delegates from France's three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The assembly closed in May without making any progress in solving the financial crisis. Before they left, the members pressured the king to sack Calonne, which he did.
 - Calonne's replacement, Etienne Charles Lomenie de Brienne, tried very hard to avoid calling the Estates General. The parlements, however, were set on this option. They figured that the nobles and clergy working together could foil the king's taxation plans once and for all. The annoyed Louis XVI dissolved the parlements, but the nobles continued to dig in their heels.
 - Finally, the king realized that he had no other choice. He would have to give in to the nobles and call the Estates General if there was to be any chance to pull France out of its deepening financial emergency. He pulled former financial minister Jacques Necker out of retirement to help. Necker had a knack for interacting with the various groups, and the king needed that kind of person by his side.
 - The Estates General met for the first time since 1614 on May 5, 1789. The estates' members reflected the hierarchical French society. All three estates - the clergy, the nobles, and the common people - were represented, but the treatment of the three was not at all equal. While the clergy and nobility sat at the front of the meeting hall and dressed in full regalia, the members of the Third Estate, mostly fairly wealthy bourgeoisie dressed in somber black robes, were squished in the back of the room where they were hard pressed to see and hear what was going on.
 - After a month of deliberations, the Estates General was no closer to solving France's problems. The Third Estate felt more left out than ever because the clergy and nobility often met in private, excluding the commoners, who were becoming more and more frustrated. Finally, the Third Estate's delegates decided to take matters into their own hands. They represented the majority of the nation, after all, and that, they felt, should give them the authority to rule. On June 17, 1789, the Third Estate broke away from the Estates General. Calling themselves the National Assembly, the delegates declared taxes illegal and demanded a new constitution.
