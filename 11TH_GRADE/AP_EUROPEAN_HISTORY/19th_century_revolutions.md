#### Europe after Napoleon
 - The decade of Napoleonic and French dominance in Europe left the leaders of Europe with significant questions concerning what post-Napoleonic Europe would look like. In response to the end of the French Empire, the powers that had defeated Napoleon convened the Congress of Vienna in September of 1814 to determine how the territories France had conquered would be divided.
 - The main objectives of the congress were to divvy up territory in a way that pleased all parties and created a balance of power such that pan-continental conflict would become impossible. Additionally, the congress sought to restore the French Bourbon monarchy, return the borders of Europe as much as possible to its pre-1793 boundaries, and eliminate the possibility of events such as the French Revolution from happening elsewhere in Europe.
 - Regardless of the desire to return Europe to its pre-1793 boundaries, certain geopolitical conditions made this impossible. For example, the Holy Roman Empire, a loose conglomeration of German and central European states, had ceased to exist after Napoleon's conquest. In its place, the congress created the German Confederation, which consisted of 39 German-speaking states formerly of the Holy Roman Empire.
 - Other territorial changes were made as well, and several were made in the interest of creating a 'balance of power' in Europe in which the power of all other states would preclude the aggression of a single state, thereby making aggressive wars, such as Napoleon's, that much harder to successfully execute. For example, within the new German Confederation, Prussian power and territory was expanded westward to provide a powerful opponent on France's eastern border. For partially the same reason, the Netherlands and the Southern Netherlands (ruled by Austria prior to the 1793 French conquest) were reunited under the Dutch House of Orange, further solidifying another state on France's eastern frontier.
 - As Prussian power was expanded in northern Germany, Austria was given further territory in what is today northern Italy to expand Austrian power in opposition to Prussian power. Poland, which had been annexed out of existence in the late 18th century, was reconstituted but placed firmly under Russian control. France, meanwhile, was stripped of all territorial acquisitions it had made since the beginning of the French Revolution in the 1790s. France, however, maintained all of pre-Revolutionary France, largely due to the achievements and influence of France's representative at the congress, Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand.

#### Conservatism vs Nationalism
 - Nationalism for a single person is the pride in oneself and those who share like traits. This usually refers to all the citizens of a country, but it can also extend beyond borders to those sharing similar linguistic, ethnic, or cultural heritage. The 19th century in Europe saw an enormous growth of regional nationalism in several areas, especially in parts of Europe that were politically fragmented, such as the German or Italian-speaking states in central and southern Europe.
 - Nationalism in Europe had two basic manifestations. The first was the type with which most people in America identify today: national pride. Nationalism in this sense was more inclusive, championing the home country and accepting as its citizenry anyone who worked toward the greater glory of the state. The second manifestation, however, was far more exclusive, and defined a 'nation' not in the political and territorial sense that we do today, but rather as a homogeneous ethnic and linguistic culture. It was not territory, but ethnicity that defined this more extremist view of nationalism.
 - 19th-century political conservatism, on the other hand, was a reaction against these new nationalist movements and other more abstract political theories that arose out of 18th and 19th-century philosophy. Indeed, nationalism was partially a product of the Enlightenment, and political conservatives in Europe railed against Enlightenment political philosophy. After all, things like democracy, universal voting rights, and other Enlightenment-based features of modern Western governments were viewed as politically subversive at the time. Conservatives in the 19th century were part of the political establishment and, therefore, invested in maintaining the current monarchies and constitutional monarchies of Europe.

 - The French Revolution terrified the conservatives of Europe: if the people of France could achieve so much when they embraced Enlightenment ideals and nationalism, what could a motivated and reform-minded populace possibly achieve in their own countries? The answers were chilling, and in order to safeguard against the possibility, the powers of Europe tried to devise a system in 1815 that would stop popular nationalist movements from threatening European monarchies.
 - This occurred at the Congress of Vienna. The chief objective of the congress was to peacefully settle the territorial disputes that arose between states in the aftermath of Napoleon's European conquest and create a balance of power that would preclude a European conquest from ever happening again. The second most important objective to the congress was undermining liberal and nationalist movements in European countries that could undermine the traditional monarchies. For example, in France, the Bourbon monarchy was replaced by the Congress of Vienna as the rightful rulers of France.

#### Liberalism and Socialism
 - 'Liberalism' today is almost a dirty word in American politics, and it's often associated with Democrats. It is actually more of a centrist economic philosophy in American politics.(Neither espicially Republican or Democratic in modern American politics) Indeed, 19th-century liberals trusted in the virtues of the free market and believed that, if left to its own devices, the market would largely regulate itself. Additionally, property and property rights were considered incredibly important by liberals. Many of the economic concepts 19th-century liberals believed in were first formulated by the 18th-century English philosopher and economist Adam Smith.
 - Hand-in-hand with this belief in economic freedom was liberalism's belief in greater political freedoms for the population. Among these were various things we today consider commonplace: universal voting rights, the right to due process of law, and freedom of religion, speech, and the press. Though we may enjoy all of these rights today, few if any of these things were standard under the monarchies of the 19th century.
 - Liberals often radically stated that sovereignty resided not in the state but in the individual, implicitly attacking the legitimacy of European monarchies. By extension, liberals believed personal freedoms were more important and more essential than the power of the government. According to liberals, the government received its power only through a group of people consenting to be governed by the government's laws. This idea was considered dangerous at the time - it undermined the traditional power structure of the monarchies where power was based at the top in the king and not in the people.
 - Liberalism's chief rival, socialism, was the product of 19th-century philosophers like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Whereas liberalism largely focused on the rights of individuals, socialism had a more collectivist mindset. Through focusing on the betterment of society as a whole and not just the predicament of individuals, socialism hoped to correct social inequality and other effects of the Industrial Revolution.
 - Socialism hoped to do this through reversing the property rights liberals so highly prized; rather than ensuring the right of the individual to own personal property, socialists believed that all property should be owned by the state. This idea was meant to confront the rampant exploitation of workers witnessed during the Industrial Revolution. Workers during the Industrial Revolution worked long hours (often 60 hours a week or more) and were paid little. According to socialists, capitalist factory owners could do this because they owned the factories, property, and resources in which the workers - the vast majority of the population - worked. The solution to this was simply to wrest control over the means of production away from the capitalists.
 - According to socialists, once the state had taken control of property, it was the duty of the state, as entrusted by the people, to distribute the resources of the state equally amongst the populace. Each person would receive adequate compensation according to their need, which would allow each worker to live and work free from worry about monetary concerns and instead focus on their work.
