### Interwar Period (1920s-1930s)

#### The Interwar Period
 - In the United States, Canada, and Europe, the 1920s are often nicknamed the Roaring Twenties. The decade saw a period of economic progress and industrial production the likes of which had never been seen before. Western factories and industrialists stopped making instruments for war and began instead to manufacture products for the public that could be sold in peacetime. The boom in industrial production fueled urbanization as people left their countryside farms to live and work in factories in major metropolitan centers.
 - The goods they produced for the public fueled a consumer culture that has sustained through the present day. Leisure and pleasure became attainable goals for industrial workers after their day or week on the factory line. Furthermore, new products that made everyday life easier continued to roll out of factories and were marketed as essential products. For example, the mass production of automobiles from assembly lines in Detroit suddenly made a family car an attainable goal.
 - The 1920s also saw a significant shift in the public lives of women. For centuries prior to WWI, women in Western society were largely expected to remain inside the home, raising children and caring for the house and their husbands. During WWI, many women worked outside the home, providing equipment and goods for the war effort. Although women were expected to relinquish their positions as men returned home from war, many women sought to maintain their presence in the public sphere.
 - Many young, unmarried women began to participate in flapper culture, a style of dress and behavior that was very modern in the 1920s. Why exactly they were called flappers is still a point of debate. One theory claims flappers were named after the fashionable, unbuckled boots they wore, which flapped as they walked. Others say that it began in England as a slang term for young prostitutes.
 - Flappers were proud of their public presence and often drank and smoked in public alongside their male counterparts, drove cars, and engaged in casual sex. In addition, they dressed counter to conventional norms, wearing shorter hair, ankle or even knee-high skirts, and hats. Flappers were abhorred by conservative women of the period and even disliked by suffragettes and feminists who viewed flapper culture as superficial. Nonetheless, flapper culture helped women gain greater acceptance in the public sphere and radically redefined women's role in society.
 - Stock market speculation, the practice of engaging in risky investments to profit from short-term fluctuations, played a huge role in precipitating the economic collapse. Speculation on the market by savvy financiers artificially inflated the prices of large portions of the stock market. Moreover, much of the money being tossed around on the market was increasingly made up of the savings of the growing American middle class. The truth was that the prosperity of the 1920s had been built upon the shaky legs of risky financial practices, and these practices led to a worldwide economic downturn, now known as the Great Depression.
 - The economic house of cards came tumbling down on October 28, 1929, a day which was infamously nicknamed 'Black Monday.' So many stocks were sold so quickly that day that many traders were forced to work through the night to simply record all the stocks that had been traded, and by the end of the day, the Dow Jones had dropped 13%. By November, the market hit rock bottom, wiping out the life savings of many middle-class investors. The ensuing panic caused even more economic ruin, as those still with deposits in savings accounts and other bank products rushed to the bank to withdraw their money. Most banks ran out of cash on hand in hours and were forced to turn away customers, telling them their life savings had vanished in a matter of hours.
 - Internationally, the collapse spread outward from the United States with alarming speed. The U.S. government and U.S. banks were owed huge sums of money by European countries, who had received large loans during WWI and afterward to aid the reconstruction of the war-torn continent. When the government and banks called in many of these loans soon after the collapse, the European banking system fell with the same rapidity that the U.S. system had collapsed. The scenes that had occurred in front of bank doors in the United States were soon played out in Madrid, London, and Paris.
 - This economic tumult coincided with the rise of fascism in several European states. Fascism is a radical political ideology characterized by an authoritarian and often xenophobic government. It was an outgrowth of the European nationalism of the 19th century. In fact, in the 19th century, nationalism led to the creation of states that had previously only been regions with ethnically and linguistically similar populations, such as Germany and Italy.
 - In the 20th century, however, this nationalism grew increasingly aggressive, especially in central Europe. In the first half of the 20th century, Italy, Spain, Germany, Japan, and other states around the world instituted fascist regimes, which often persecuted ethnic and religious minorities within the state. Being a foreigner in any of these countries became increasingly dangerous.
 - Characterized by strict authoritarian regimes and often aggressively nationalist, xenophobic, and racist attitudes, these fascist governments instituted policies meant to glorify the nation and the ethnicity, while eliminating all others. This aggressive fascism eventually led to WWII and the Holocaust, which was the systematic murder of approximately six million Jews by Adolf Hitler's fascist German government.

#### Weimar Republic
 - Often in history, periods and figures can get lost in the shuffle, especially if they are surrounded by even larger and more important events. Perhaps there is no better example of this than the Weimar Republic in Germany, which lasted from 1919 to 1933. Bookended by World War I and the rise of the Nazis and World War II, this lesson examines that curious time in Germany between the two most momentous wars of the previous century.
 - Prior to World War I, Germany had been a relatively democratic federal republic, ruled by a triumvirate of the Kaiser, the Bundesrat, and an Imperial Diet that was elected via universal male suffrage. Unfortunately, defeat in World War I in 1918 and the terms imposed upon the German Empire by the victorious allies caused economic hardship in Germany and soon after, the collapse of the government.
 - For example, in order to pay the massive debt the allies imposed upon the German government, the German government resolved to simply print more money. This caused rampant hyperinflation, which made the German currency, the Deutschmark, virtually worthless, and horror stories emerged of men and women carrying wheelbarrows full of money to the store to simply buy a loaf of bread.
 - In the midst of the chaos, several factions vied for political power. For example, a strong communist movement named the Spartacists controlled Berlin, forcing the centrist German nationalists to declare the German Republic in Weimar, Germany, hence giving the period and the republic its name. The institution of the Weimar Republic in 1919 intended to create the best democracy possible in Germany.
 - It gave both men and women over the age of 20 the right to vote on a president and a representative assembly, named the Reichstag. Unfortunately, the nature of the voting system made the Reichstag home to an enormous number of political parties and platforms and very little could actually be achieved as a result. By 1923 Weimar Germany was nearing total collapse, as economic problems and rival political guerrilla movements persisted, all the while Germany's new democracy proved unable to achieve anything of substance.
 - The successes of the Dawes Plan, however, were short-lived. It soon became apparent that the German economy depended entirely on infusions of cash from foreign governments. In 1929, shortly after the death of Stresemann, the Wall Street market collapse caused economic ruin throughout the Western world, but most significantly at the collapse's epicenter, the United States. The U.S. had been Germany's largest loaner in the 1920s, and after the market collapse the U.S. government and private banks could not afford to lend money to Germany.
 - With the constant infusions of foreign cash removed, the fragile German economy unraveled. Factories shut down and workers were laid off by the thousands, unemployment soaring to over six million by January 1933. Indeed, many of the same problems which Weimar Germany had faced in its infancy cropped up again, and Germans threw their support behind rival, extremist political factions.
 - In the 1930 election, only a year after the collapse of the stock market, both the Communist and Nazi parties of Germany made significant advances, each picking up over 100 seats in the Reichstag. In 1932, the Nazi party picked up even more seats and became the largest party in the German Reichstag.
 - With these successes at the ballot box, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party began to consolidate power over the German government and slowly unravel the democratic practices of the Weimar Republic. The Nazi party pushed through several decrees which gave both Hitler and the presidency more power over the German government, and in July of 1933 the Weimar Republic was effectively over when the Reichstag declared the Nazi party as the only legal political party in Germany. When the German president died the following year, the office was abolished and its powers absorbed by the chancellor, Adolf Hitler.

#### The Great Depression
 - The heights to which 1920s society climbed worsened the impact of the economic ruin of the following decade. Moreover, much of this prosperity was built upon the shaky legs of risky financial practices, which precipitated the collapse. Indeed, many of the stores offering these new items, like automobiles and refrigerators, offered their own forms of credit at high interest to consumers. When consumers began failing to make payments, the businesses were forced to eat that loss.
 - In addition, banks were lending money without safeguards against financial crises. Banks were lending out huge sums of money and using customer deposits to do so. Furthermore, they were accepting those same customer deposits without any guarantee that their money would be immediately available to them in the future.
 - Additionally, stock market speculation played a huge role in precipitating the economic collapse. Speculation on the market by savvy financiers had artificially inflated the prices of large portions of the stock market. Moreover, much of the money being tossed around on the market was increasingly made up of the savings of the growing American middle class.
 - his economic house of cards came tumbling down on October 28, 1929, a day which was infamously named 'Black Monday.' Several economic indicators pointed to a possible collapse. For example, in 1926, the housing market in Florida collapsed, and land speculators in the state were ruined. In addition, banks that had loaned out too much capital were beginning to fail in 1929, and food prices were beginning to fall, ruining farmers who had produced a vast amount of food to sell at the artificially inflated prices of the 1920s.
 - When the opening bell rang on Wall Street on October 28, stock prices immediately began to tumble. So many stocks were sold so quickly that day that many traders were forced to work through the night to simply record all the stocks which had been traded, and by the end of the day, the Dow Jones had dropped 13%. The following day, stock prices continued to plummet, dropping another 12%. By November, the market had hit rock bottom, wiping out many middle class investors' life savings.
 - The ensuing panic caused even more economic ruin, as those still with deposits in savings accounts and other bank products rushed to the bank to withdraw their money. Most banks ran out of cash on hand in hours and were forced to turn customers away, telling them their life savings had vanished in a matter of hours.
 - The economic collapse that occurred after the Wall Street market collapse of 1929 affected all sectors of the country and aspects of society. Unemployment skyrocketed nationally to approximately 25%, leaving one in four men out of work, and it rose far higher in some regions.
 - Hoovervilles - named for President Herbert Hoover, in office at the time of the collapse - sprang up across the country. These were shantytowns along the banks of rivers where families who had emerged from the collapse penniless and unemployed lived. Millions of Americans picked up what few belongings they had and traveled the country, looking for work from town to town. Though things got marginally better with the New Deal policies of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was elected in 1932, the country did not truly get out of the Depression until it entered World War II in 1941.
