### The Scientific Revolution

#### Pre-Scientific Revolution
 - Furthermore, the Middle Ages were not a complete period of intellectual stagnation in Europe, and isolated universities often carried on the traditions of learning. The thinkers that attended these universities and schools of the Middle Ages often practiced scholasticism. Scholasticism differed from the logic and reason of the Enlightenment era, which often cast aside all facts in an attempt to recognize universal truth. Instead, scholasticism started with accepted truth, whether it was the Bible or the ancient Greek and Roman work. Then, scholars proceeded to read the works critically, making notations and debating with their colleagues in an attempt to understand, interpret, and make inferences to better understand the work's meaning and its applications to the contemporary world.
 - Furthermore, the scientific method - upon which the later Scientific Revolution and most modern science class experiments are based - was first pioneered during this period. Various men, including Robert Grosseteste and the Arab thinker Avicenna, built upon the Aristotelian emphasis on empiricism to show that future events could be predicted by examining past results. The key to the entire method, however, was Roger Bacon, a 13th-century Englishman who was the first man to formulate the scientific method as we would recognize it, where the scientist observes and identifies a question, forms a hypothesis, then devises an experiment to test whether their hypothesis is true.

#### Ptolemy and the Ptolemaic System
 - We know very little about the life of Ptolemy. He was likely born around 100 A.D. and died around 170 A.D. His name suggests he was of Greek descent, though his family likely held citizenship in the Roman Empire. Despite these roots, he was born, lived, and died in the vicinity of Alexandria in Egypt.
 - What sets Ptolemy apart from many of his contemporaries is the book he wrote, likely completed around 150 A.D. The book, originally titled The Mathematical Compilation, is more commonly known by its Latinized Arab title: The Almagest. In The Almagest, Ptolemy compiled a list of all the known stars in the night sky and proposed a fundamental structure to explain the motion of the stars and the heavenly bodies. This structure, known as the Ptolemaic system, remained the prevailing theory concerning the universe among many intellectuals and astronomers for over a thousand years until the late Middle Ages.
 - Ptolemy worked feverishly throughout his life, observing the stars and making careful notations. He built upon the work of others, like Hipparchus and Aristotle, and he likely was taught by the great Theon of Smyrna, an accomplished mathematician and astronomer in his own right. Though Ptolemy's astronomical work was his most important as far as we are concerned, Ptolemy also wrote on various topics, including geography, optics, and music.
 - According to the Ptolemaic system, the universe was necessarily geocentric. This was due in large part to the Greek theory that explained what we know today as gravity. According to the Greeks, all matter naturally fell to the center of the universe. As birds, arrows, and people all fall to the Earth if dropped from the sky, Earth must necessarily be at the center of the universe.
 - But what then, you might ask, keeps the moon, the sun, and the stars from crashing down from the sky? According to the Ptolemaic system, the heavenly bodies remained suspended in the sky as they were attached to crystalline spheres. Ptolemy built upon the theories first proposed by his predecessor Aristotle, who claimed that the heavens contained 55 of these crystalline, translucent spheres, with each larger one encompassing all the others.
 - Upon these concentric spheres, the planets, the moon, and the sun were all attached. Upon the largest and furthest away sphere were pasted the faintest stars. These spheres all rotated around the Earth at separate speeds. The furthest of these spheres was imparted with a speed by a being Aristotle called the 'Prime Mover.' All of the other spheres rotated due to the angular momentum produced by the force first imparted on this last sphere. The Aristotelian theory explained some of the motion of the stars but not all, and it was often incorrect. For example, it often failed to account for retrograde motion, when some planets and stars appeared to move backward in the night sky after a long period of moving in one direction. To tackle this problem, Ptolemy invented epicycles and deferent points.
 - Many examples of models of these spheres still survive today, and are frequently found at museums and in private collections across the world. 
 - The Ptolemaic system became the accepted structure of the universe throughout the Western world. That Ptolemy's calculations could predict accurately the movement of the stars and planets gave his system tremendous credibility with ancient and medieval stargazers.
 - Furthermore, the Ptolemaic system fit well into the worldview espoused by Christianity, which spread across Europe as the Roman Empire declined. For example, Ptolemy's geocentric universe pleased Christian ears who believed humanity and the Earth to be God's one special creation. Furthermore, the 'Prime Mover' to which Ptolemy ascribed the ability to spin the spheres easily adapted to become Christianity's one God.

#### Tycho Brahe and Copernicus burn the established system to the ground
 - Nicolaus Copernicus was a mathematician and a clergyman from Poland. When he went to college to study canon law, he lived with an astronomer. He would have also come into contact with humanist scholars as he studied. At this time, he was introduced to both astronomy and the study of ancient Greeks.
 - Copernicus agreed with Ptolemy's idea of epicycles but disagreed with some of Ptolemy's theory. He proposed that the sun was the center of the universe and that the planets revolved around it. This theory is called the heliocentric system. He also said that the Earth not only moved around the sun, but it also spun on an axis.
 - Copernicus's theory appeared to some to conflict with the writings of the Christian Bible. They claimed that the scripture states that the Earth cannot be moved. Copernicus published his theory in a book called De Revolutionibus.
 - His theories were not widely accepted, as they went against some of the fundamental tenets of scripture ats they were seen then - and he did not find commercial success with his book.
 - Tycho Brahe was a rich Danish man from a noble family. When he went to a university to study law, he also developed an interest in astronomy. Brahe was the last major astronomer to work without the use of a telescope. However, he worked hard to make sure he had the highest quality instruments. He basically enlarged and improved instruments that were already being used to help increase his accuracy.
 - Brahe wanted to find a way to merge Ptolemy's theories with those of Copernicus. He proposed that the Sun and the moon revolve around the Earth, allowing the Earth to remain the center of the universe. However, he also said that the other planets revolved around the sun.


#### Science During the Enlightenment Period 
 - Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is arguably the most important figure of the Scientific Revolution. In his monumentally important work Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Newton formulated the Laws of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. Newton was giant of his field, and his discoveries form the basis of modern science today.
 - Many scientists of the 16th and 17th century concerned themselves with what they called mechanical philosophy. Mechanical philosophy dealt with issues of matter and motion, and in many ways was a fancy word for 'physics.' Some scientists in the field even proposed primitive variations of atomic theory. René Descartes was a notable pioneer in mechanical philosophy.
 - A major innovation of the Scientific Revolution was the improved scientific method. The scientific method, of course, is a technique for testing hypotheses and arriving at fact. Now, primitive forms of deductive scientific reasoning have been around since ancient times. The modern scientific method, however, as we know, is a direct product of the Scientific Revolution. Men like Francis Bacon and René Descartes were instrumental in developing the modern scientific method.
 - Advances were also made in anatomy, mathematics, and other fields. Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564), often considered the 'Father of Human Anatomy,' published On the Structure of the Human Body in 1543. This was a tremendous improvement from previous anatomy texts and had a major influence on the discipline. Other well-known scientists include William Gilbert, who pioneered work in magnetism and electricity, and the mathematician Blaise Pascal, who invented the mechanical calculator and made significant contributions to the area of mathematical probability.

#### The Enlightenment Thinkers 
 - Many of the ideas and philosophical theories that gained popularity during the Enlightenment emerged from attempts to answer the philosophical questions posed by the scientific achievement and discovery of the previous century. Several primary Church teachings about the nature of the universe and man's place in it were fundamentally questioned by discoveries from this period. These included the Copernican model of the universe, Newtonian physics, and religious deism. These ideas used together viewed the universe as being governed by natural, measurable laws. This wasn't exactly in line with the Church's ideas concerning existence.
 - The previous century's emphasis on reason created a philosophical basis upon which many Enlightenment thinkers built. A lot of 17th-century philosophers, like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, preferred to start from scratch, basing their philosophies upon personal, observable phenomena rather than accepting the authority of another source. Skepticism of accepted knowledge was taken to its theoretical limit by the French philosopher René Descartes when he went so far as to question his very existence (you know: the guy who said 'I think, therefore I am'). The reliance on one's own logic and reasoning has led some historians to call these preceding, 17th-century philosophical developments the 'Age of Reason.'
 - Locke's political philosophy and Newton's scientific achievements in the late 17th and early 18th centuries were pivotal developments that allowed for the growth of the Enlightenment. Locke's political philosophy stemmed from his central belief that humanity was innately good and industrious. He believed that if given the proper tools and power, humans would form a society which would be good for all and improve the community's well-being. As such, societies could be trusted to decide which form of government was right and just. If a society was ruled unfairly or arbitrarily by an inept monarch, the people were justified in rebelling against the king or queen. Locke's ideas were a complete 180 in how monarchies were viewed: the king still held the power, but that power originated in society, and the monarch only held that power by the consent of those he ruled. This important distinction became known as social contract theory, and many 18th-century writers based their political philosophy on this idea.
 - While Locke laid the foundation for a lot of 18th-century political philosophy, Isaac Newton's theories of gravitation did the same for modern science. These ideas were featured in the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy published in 1687. This forever changed science and showed that the universe was governed by natural, quantifiable laws. From Newton's laws the philosophers understood that the universe was rational, comprehensible and ordered. These were ideas that fit well into deism - that is, the belief that God created the universe but does not take an active hand in its events.
 - These new beliefs and the new learning and research they spawned flourished throughout the Enlightenment. Two Frenchmen, Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert are primarily responsible for the spread. They undertook an enormous project attempting to document industrial innovation, discoveries in natural science, and all knowledge in general. This project resulted in a wildly successful book, the Encyclopédie, first published in the 1750s.
 - The Encyclopédie not only attempted to gather as much knowledge about the world as possible, but also tried to organize knowledge into working groups that corresponded to human abilities. For example, Diderot claimed memory was the chief human ability used in the discipline of history, while man's imagination was reserved for poetry. The Encyclopédie was incredibly successful largely due to its instructional usefulness (one of Diderot's main objectives was to make mechanical industry understandable to any literate person) and the enormous number of etchings and diagrams that accompanied the explanations.
 - The understanding of the natural world fostered by Diderot and d'Alembert was equaled in the political sphere by the work of Charles-Louis de Secondat, the Baron de Montesquieu. Montesquieu's 1748 work, The Spirit of Laws sought not only to recognize and explain the existing laws and governments of Western Europe, but also understand the very basis for law's existence.
 - Montesquieu's abhorrence of despotism and governmental corruption caused him to create the philosophical justification for a common feature of modern Western government: the separation of powers and the checks and balances system. These were meant to keep one branch of government from getting more powerful than another.
 - The Enlightenment perhaps found its greatest manifestation in two mid-17th century philosophers, the Scotsman David Hume and the Frenchman Voltaire. Voltaire's unbending skepticism and wit, and his opposition to fanatics and metaphysicists, make his own personal philosophy hard to pinpoint. It's probably what makes him the quintessential Enlightenment philosopher.
 - That said, Voltaire believed strongly in personal liberties versus the power of the state as well as the virtues of empirical science. Perhaps Voltaire's greatest legacy to philosophy and science was properly separating the two disciplines by explaining that abstract philosophical thought was pointless when it directly contradicted empirical data. Voltaire considered metaphysical explanations of the universe that relied on independent reasoning rather than empirical conclusions to be his biggest enemy. He hated this so much that he featured the idea heavily in his satirical 1759 novel, Candide.
 - David Hume was essentially Voltaire's philosophical adversary. While Hume believed in the importance of empiricism, he denied the existence of any knowledge that didn't place the human experience at the center of reality. He argued that a person's personal experiences are as close as one can hope to get to the true reality of existence.
 - Hume is known as something of a controversial character in the history of philosophy, however his ideas were extremely influential. His personal friendship with Adam Smith, the author of The Wealth of Nations, also helped to spread his ideas.
 
#### Denis Diderot and the Encyclopedia
 -Born in 1713 in Langres, France, Diderot received his education from local Jesuits before enrolling in the University of Paris. There, Diderot received a Master of Arts degree and then chose to eschew his father's wishes that he continue his study in either medicine or law. Instead, he chose the rather hard life of an 18th-century writer, wandering from writing job to writing job, sprinkling in tutoring early students and selling books along the way.
 - In the 1740s, Diderot began producing his own philosophical tracts, often publishing anonymously. His first, for instance, Pensées Philosophiques, was published without an author in 1746. In it, Diderot critiqued Christianity and competing ideologies of the Enlightenment, like deism. The work was considered too controversial and was subsequently burned by the French government. Diderot also dabbled in other forms of writing, once writing a novel for his lover to back up his boast to her that writing a novel was easy.
 - Diderot's eclectic writing tastes are representative of his period. Diderot is perhaps the best example of the typical philosopher of the Enlightenment period. The Enlightenment flourished in France and elsewhere in Europe from roughly the last decades of the 17th century until the French Revolution at the end of the 18th. Enlightenment thinkers, like Diderot, espoused reason and logic above all else. They questioned accepted truths, such as the teachings of Christianity, and instead built belief systems based on empiricism and logical reasoning.
 - Indeed, Diderot intended the project, which he titled the Encyclopedia or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, as a compilation of knowledge for its own sake, stating it was meant 'to further knowledge, and, by so doing, strike a resounding blow against reactionary forces in church and state.' The Encyclopedia not only attempted to gather as much knowledge about the world as possible, but also tried to organize knowledge into working groups that corresponded to human abilities.
 - For example, Diderot claimed memory was the chief human ability used in the discipline of history, while man's imagination was reserved for poetry. The Encyclopedia was intended to be instructionally useful. One of Diderot's main objectives was to make mechanical industry understandable to any literate person. An enormous number of etchings and diagrams accompanied the explanations.
 - This project experienced initial hiccups. Diderot was dismayed when his editor heavily revised portions of the first volume, published in 1751. Jesuits in France denounced the Encyclopedia as an attack on their teachings and claimed the history it provided attacked the Catholic saints. Such charges were brought to the attention of King Louis XV, who enabled a panel of censors to review the book. Shortly after the second volume was published in 1752, the Encyclopedia was denounced by the panel and its publication suppressed by royal order.
 - Despite these initial problems, Diderot was soon authorized to resume his work on the Encyclopedia largely thanks to his friends in the French government. Diderot continued to complete volumes, publishing the third and fourth in 1753 and 1754, respectively. In all, 28 volumes of the Encyclopedia were published, all compiled, written, and worked on by Diderot.
 - The project was wildly successful and popular with nearly every literate person who could afford the immense volumes. For example, the Encyclopedia was so popular with leaders in colonial America that Benjamin Franklin purportedly approached Diderot's publishers to possibly begin a distribution operation in the colonies, though the plan never came to fruition. Diderot worked on the Encyclopedia for the rest of his life until his death in 1784.


#### The Scottish Enlightenment
 - David Hume was arguably the Scottish Enlightenment's most powerful mind. Born near Edinburgh in 1711, by age 11 he was enrolled at the University of Edinburgh. Hume began life as a devoutly religious adolescent, though by his university years, his notes show he spent a profound amount of time questioning the existence of God and almost certainly spent most of his adult life as a secret atheist. Indeed, in the 1740s, he was denied the Chair of Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh because the town council felt his writings were too controversial and anti-religious.
 - Hume spent most of his adult life working as a librarian in Glasgow, though his main pursuit was his philosophical and historical writing. His first work, the three-volume Treatise of Human Nature, was poorly received in its time. Today, it's considered a philosophical masterpiece, where Hume explores free will, causality, time, and the existence of God.
 - Philosophically, Hume was a firm believer in both skepticism and empiricism. Hume believed the only things that could be considered truths in this world were things that could be measured and observed. However, while Hume believed in the importance of empiricism, he denied the existence of any knowledge that didn't place the human experience at the center of reality.
 - He argued that a person's personal experiences are as close as one can hope to get to the true reality of existence. Hume consistently took this extreme skepticism and human perception-centered empiricism to its theoretical limit, at one point claiming that objects themselves did not exist: the only thing that existed was the bundle of properties that humans could perceive. 
 - Hume is far more highly regarded now than he was in his time, likely due to his highly controversial philosophical conclusions. Indeed, his contemporaries across Europe often went to great lengths to attack his philosophy and works. However, in the modern day Hume is considered one of the most influential philosophers of all time, and his ideas are still studied and debated today.
 - One of Hume's closest friends in Scotland was another intellectual giant of the period, the far more well-received Adam Smith. Born in 1723 in Kirkcaldy, Smith went to Glasgow College at the age of 13 before attending Oxford University. Smith read Hume's works while at Oxford, and after Smith's graduation the two became close friends. It's likely Hume even helped Smith get his first teaching position as the Chair of Logic at Glasgow University.
 - Though Smith's greatest impact on the modern world was in economic theory, Smith was more than just an economist. Smith's philosophical writings encompassed everything, from the nature of humanity to epistemology. His first work, for example, A Theory of Moral Sentiments, discussed the nature of knowledge and the importance of empiricism. Indeed, Smith largely shared his friend Hume's penchant for empiricism. Smith believed that the only way humans could know something with certainty was through seeing, measuring, or experiencing it themselves. However, he was not nearly as skeptical as Hume.
 - Smith's philosophical views provided the framework from which he built logically sound political and economic theories, which would eventually change the way most of the Western world viewed commercial exchanges. Smith laid all this out in his 1776 work, The Wealth of Nations. In it, Smith attacks many of the existing practices in the 18th-century English economy. He considered both the guild systems and mercantile systems, prevalent in England and Europe, to be unduly restraining on the economy.
 - Instead, Smith argued for the importance of self-interested commercial exchanges. In addition, he claimed that through dividing labor amongst men, things could be produced at a far quicker rate. Sounds like modern economics, well, that's because it is. 
 - His ideas were especially well received in the American colonies, who were chafing under British requirements that the colonies only import from the Empire and export to Britain.
 - As enormous figures as Hume and Smith were, they were not the only men of the Scottish Enlightenment. Indeed, perhaps more than in any other country, the members of the Scottish Enlightenment were a close-knit group who often read and critiqued each other's work. For example, Francis Hutcheson, a well-respected philosopher and minister in his own right, taught Adam Smith at Glasgow before returning to his home country of Ireland.
 - The Scottish Enlightenment was more than just philosophy and economics. For example, James Hutton, a Scottish naturalist from Edinburgh, was the first to recognize that Earth was likely far older than the six thousand years that the Bible claimed. Indeed, Hutton realized that the Earth's features were shaped by long processes such as wind and erosion. Many consider him one of the founding fathers of modern geology.

#### Cesare Beccaria
 - Beccaria was an Italian born in Milan to an aristocratic family in 1738. After a strict childhood education by Jesuits, Beccaria enrolled in the University of Parma where he received a law degree in 1758. Afterward, Beccaria returned to Milan where he angered his parents by marrying below his social class in 1761.
 - It was not only in marriage where Beccaria would break with tradition. Soon after his return to Milan, he and two friends formed the Academy of Fists. Modeled on other Enlightenment-era intellectual groups, the literary threesome claimed to be 'dedicated to waging relentless war against economic disorder, bureaucratic petty tyranny, religious narrow-mindedness and intellectual pedantry.' The threesome researched and wrote articles over various topics concerning economics, law and other areas prone to contemporary debate. For example, Beccaria's first published essay was 'On Remedies for the Monetary Disorders of Milan in the year 1762.'
 - Beccaria's most famous work, however, was published in 1764. Beccaria first published the essay 'On Crimes and Punishments' anonymously. He did this because the work critiqued several existing practices in the 18th-century Milanese justice system, in addition to laying out several theories rethinking the very basis of justice and penal codes. Only after the government accepted the work did Beccaria let his identity be known.
 - The essay was widely read across Europe in enlightened circles and by leaders of state, like Catherine the Great, gaining Beccaria continent-wide acclaim. So popular did Beccaria's essay become that he was invited to tour Paris by intellectual circles there. Beccaria accepted, but cut his trip short after he failed to fit in. The quiet Beccaria quickly gained a reputation in France as being immature and an idiot. After returning, Beccaria failed to publish anything further, and he cut ties with his friends from the Academy of Fists. He then moved to Austria, where he worked quietly for the Austrian government until his death in 1794.
