### The Effects of the Reformation

#### The Sack of Rome
 - Francois and Bourbon wanted to expand French borders, but neither of them had enough money to fund the expedition. They began borrowing money, assuming they would be able to pay it back after conquering a rich Italian province called Lombardy.
 - Bourbon also used some of his money to hire mercenaries from Germany to fight against the Swiss mercenaries currently fighting for Lombardy. Mercenaries are soldiers that are hired to fight rather than being part of a national defense system. Mercenaries didn't fight for their nation of origin, but instead went where the money was. Mercenaries could fight against one country and then fight for them in the future, depending on who hired them. The French troops, along with the German mercenaries, led a successful campaign into the Italian province.
 - When the forces returned, Bourbon asked the King for funds to pay off his debtors. The King, however, didn't have enough money to pay off his own debts. Bourbon waited two years and asked for money again. Although the King was agreeable, he was in no hurry to comply with Bourbon's request. Bourbon finally obtained financial help through his cousin, also named Charles, who was the prince of Austria. 
 - Charles of Austria was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. Francois was unhappy with this decision and wanted the title for himself. Francois wasn't sure he could trust Bourbon's loyalty, so he asked Bourbon to marry his mother. Bourbon refused, and Francois claimed ownership of all of Bourbon's property. Bourbon had to go to court to fight for his estate, but meanwhile, Francois continued to petition Bourbon with marriages to women in his family.
 - Bourbon became irritated with Francois' behavior and fled to Spain, where his cousin, Charles V, was preparing to invade France. Bourbon joined the fight with his German mercenaries. Francois was captured, and Bourbon demanded that Francois return his land and his money. Francois agreed, but when he was set free, he sold all of Bourbon's land to French aristocracy. Bourbon had to ask his cousin for more money, but Charles V was busy with rebellions against his empire. 
 - Charles V made Bourbon the Duke of Milan and provided him with an army of French and German troops. However, the mercenaries became angry when they didn't get paid for their service. Bourbon began selling his own possessions to pay them. He eventually allowed the troops to attack neighboring cities to loot the cities and churches to help pay their salaries.
 - Bourbon and his troops decided to attack the city of Rome. Rome was considered sacred by Catholics. Because of Rome's holy status, it had little in the area of defense. The city was thought to be safe, as few would dare attack a place held in such high regard. However, a movement had begun among Christians to rebel against the authority of the Church as the Reformation continued.
 - Bourbon attacked in May of 1527. During the attack, Bourbon was killed, but his troops defeated the city. The sack lasted a little over a week, but it is thought Rome was in chaos for months. The city was looted and many buildings and monuments destroyed. By the end of the summer, thousands of men, women, and children had either fled or were killed in the attack. Many soldiers, both Catholic and Protestant, as well as some locals, participated in the murder and looting.
 - The sack of Rome also had an impact on the Renaissance culture Rome was known for at the time. During the Renaissance period, many people began to rediscover cla\ssical literature from ancient Greece and Rome. Artists began to show more complexity in their work while including a strong emphasis on classical traditions. After Rome was attacked, many artists and architects fled the city, hoping to find safety elsewhere. This event is generally seen to have marked the end of the High Renaissance in Rome.

#### The Council of Trent
 - It's hard to imagine that such a massive movement from the Protestants and Catholic reformers did not completely destroy the Catholic Church, but Catholicism managed to survive. From December 13, 1545, to December 4, 1563, an ecumenical council (councils where Church officials are allowed to vote on decrees that are considered binding to all Christians) convened to address concerns of the Catholic Church. This council is known as the Council of Trent.
 - The Council of Trent met to define the doctrines of the Catholic Church. The idea was to lessen corruption of clergy members and abuses of power and finances. The council determined that the Church's interpretation of the Bible was the final word but that the Bible had equal authority with the Church. Rituals like indulgences, pilgrimages, and veneration of saints were upheld. Although the structure of the Church saw little change, a greater emphasis was placed on discipline and education in the clergy.
 - The Council of Trent marked the beginning of the period known as the Counter-Reformation. The Council of Trent inspired a movement of reform and revival within the Catholic Church. Religious orders gained popularity and support from the Pope during this time. The Church worked to keep their organizational structure while preventing political and financial abuses. Catholicism's popularity grew in light of these changes.

#### Life after the Reformation
 - As the Reformation progressed, changes in power occurred. While the clergy began to lose authority, the local rulers and nobles collected it for themselves. Peasants became resentful and revolted, but their actions were condemned by Luther. Their attempts to gain freedom from oppression ended in stricter oppression and even death for some. The Reformation seemed to lessen the opportunity for peasants to challenge their place in the class structure.
 - Middle class members, better educated than ever before, were able to challenge the authority of the Church and their interpretations of the bible.
 - Education was an important factor in the Reformation. After the Council of Trent, the Catholic Church allowed for more education for its clergy members. The importance of education for all children also became apparent. Luther believed people were capable of determining their religious beliefs by independent thinking, but education was the foundation of good independent thought. During this time, girls were also encouraged to pursue education.

#### The House of Bourbon
 - When the Reformation came to France, its message spread quickly. By 1534, there were estimated to be over 30,000 followers of Luther within the city of Paris. Although facing great persecution from the French throne, Protestantism continued to grow. However, the new converts lacked organization. Without a unified leader, their cries for reform went unheeded.
 - This all changed when Calvinism came to France. Calvinism, named after the 16th century reformer John Calvin, held that only God has complete authority over humanity, salvation, and the Church. In other words, the pope is not the end all authority. He, like the rest of humanity, is subject to God. In John Calvin, the French Protestants had found a leader.
 - By 1559, Protestant churches were popping up all over Catholic France. It was about this time that French Protestants came to be known as Huguenots. Many of these Huguenots were from the aristocratic class. This meant they had political power to back up their beliefs. As they began to gain popularity and power, King Henry II, France's Catholic ruler, called for their arrest and execution. This persecution lasted until Henry's death and the ascension of his son, King Charles IX.
 - Coming to the throne as a young man, Charles realized religious moderation was his best chance at maintaining power. However, many other nobles disagreed and continued their siege against the Huguenots. One such nobleman was Henry Duke of Guise, whose family sparked the 1562 Massacre at Vassy in which dozens of unarmed Protestants were slaughtered. This violence signaled the beginning of the French Wars of Religion, a series of conflicts in which the Huguenots fought for religious freedom.
 - Violence escalated when King Charles' sister was promised in marriage to her Huguenot cousin, Henry of Bourbon, King of Navarre. Upon hearing this, Catholic extremists were outraged. Knowing many leading Huguenots would come to Paris for the festivities; the extremists hatched a violent plan.
 - On August 23, 1572, St. Bartholomew's Day, the bells of Paris were rung, signaling the extremists to take up arms against the unsuspecting Huguenots. This began a massacre of French Protestants, which lasted for three days. By the time the Catholics were finished, thousands of Huguenots lay dead in what has come to be known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre.
 - Like his brother, Henry III tried to take the course of religious moderation, but war still raged within France. Unfortunately for those who agreed with Henry III's moderate stance, he was assassinated by a Catholic extremist in the year 1589.
 - Although Henry's assassination seemed like a win for the Catholic extremists, it would soon backfire. Since Henry died without an heir, the next in line for the throne was none other than Henry of Bourbon. Making matters worse for the Catholics, Henry Bourbon was not just a military leader, he was a skilled politician.
 - Since he was a Protestant, Bourbon realized the Catholics in France would never rest while he sat on the throne. In a rather crafty move, Bourbon renounced his Protestant faith. Whether sincere or not, this gained him enough Catholic support to take the crown as King Henry IV in the year 1594. With this move, the House of Bourbon came to the French throne.
 - Although Henry of Bourbon reigned as the Catholic Henry IV, he did not forget his Protestant friends. In fact, he continued to be one of its greatest allies. In 1598, he issued the Edict of Nantes, which granted civil rights to the Huguenots. Although Catholicism remained in control, the Huguenots were given cities in which they could freely worship. With this freedom, the Huguenots also gained political power, almost becoming a free republic within the borders of France.
 - Following the death of Henry, his son Louis XII who was a devout Catholic took the throne. Desiring unquestioned power, Louis chose Cardinal Richelieu, his chief minister, to deal with the bothersome Huguenots. Richelieu, who took his job quite seriously, renewed the persecution of the Huguenots, and stripped them of much of their political power. However, he did not rescind the Edict of Nantes. (Unrelated to this, Richelieu was also a talented military leader, especially in naval matters, and made Brest the major port of the French fleet.)
