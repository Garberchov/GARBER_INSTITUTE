#### Planck's Constant
 - Planck's constant is a number that describes the size of the energy packets (or 'quanta') that are contained within light. These packets of energy are called photons. Planck's constant is given the symbol h in physics and numerically is equal to $6.63 x 10^-34$ Joule seconds.
 - Towards the end of the 19th century, Planck was working to understand black-body radiation -- a kind of radiation that would be emitted by a perfect absorber and emitter of radiation. This is very close to the kind of radiation we receive from the sun. Planck successfully created an equation to describe black-body radiation, but then realized his solution was one of many, which could lead to many different values of energy produced.
 - In a last-ditch attempt to make his ideas work, he proposed that the energy of light was not a continuous quantity -- you couldn't just have absolutely any value of energy. Rather, light must contain packets of energy of a particular size. Although it was an act of desperation, he turned out to be right and won a Nobel Prize in 1918 for his work.
 - While Planck's constant can now be found in many equations, the equation that defines Planck's constant is called the Planck-Einstein relation, and it looks like this: E = hf.
 - Here, E is the energy of each packet (or 'quanta') of light, measured in Joules; f is the frequency of light, measured in hertz; and h is of course Planck's constant. So the constant describes how to take the frequency (or color) of light and use it to determine the size of the packets of energy (or photons) it contains.
 - It's a pretty straight-forward equation, but one that was part of a revolution in physics. Understanding the existence of these 'quanta' led over the following few decades to the development of quantum mechanics, a topic that has revolutionized physics and, in turn, led to huge advances in the world.

#### The Bohr Model and Atomic Spectra
 - We're going to start off this lesson by focusing on just the hydrogen atom because it's a simple atom with a very simple electronic structure. It only has one electron which is located in the 1s orbital. Recall from a previous lesson that 1s means it has a principal quantum number of 1. This means it's in the first and lowest energy level, and because it is in an s orbital, it will be found in a region that is shaped like a sphere surrounding the nucleus.
 - All we are going to focus on in this lesson is the energy level, or the 1 (sometimes written as n=1). This little electron is located in the lowest energy level, called the ground state, meaning that it has the lowest energy possible. When you write electron configurations for atoms, you are writing them in their ground state.
 - So, if this electron is now found in the ground state, can it be found in another state? Absolutely. If this electron gets excited, it can move up to the second, third or even a higher energy level. But what causes this electron to get excited? Adding energy to an electron will cause it to get excited and move out to a higher energy level. The more energy that is added to the atom, the farther out the electron will go. In a later lesson, we'll discuss what happens to the electron if too much energy is added.
 - A couple of ways that energy can be added to an electron is in the form of heat, in the case of fireworks, or electricity, in the case of neon lights. When these forms of energy are added to atoms, their electrons take that energy and use it to move out to outer energy levels farther away from the nucleus.
 - Now, those electrons can't stay away from the nucleus in those high energy levels forever. Eventually, the electrons will fall back down to lower energy levels. If the electrons are going from a high-energy state to a low-energy state, where is all this extra energy going? Energy doesn't just disappear.
 - As electrons transition from a high-energy orbital to a low-energy orbital, the difference in energy is released from the atom in the form of a photon. A photon is a weightless particle of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation comes in many forms: heat, light, ultraviolet light and x-rays are just a few. The most important feature of this photon is that the larger the transition the electron makes to produce it, the higher the energy the photon will have.
 - Think of this as kind of like an atomic version of what happens to satellites. Even though there is no "atmosphere" in outer space, small particles of dust and gasses will slowly decelerate the satellite requiring corrective burns to stay in orbit.
 - High-energy photons are going to look like higher-energy colors: purple, blue and green, whereas lower-energy photons are going to be seen as lower-energy colors like red, orange and yellow. Remember those colors of the rainbow - red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet? Those are listed in the order of increasing energy. Essentially, each transition that this hydrogen electron makes will correspond to a different amount of energy and a different color that is being released. This is called its atomic spectrum.
 - This led to the Bohr model of the atom, in which a small, positive nucleus is surrounded by electrons located in very specific energy levels. For example, whenever a hydrogen electron drops from the fifth energy level to the second energy level, it always gives off a violet light with a wavelength of 434.1 nanometers. A wavelength is just a numerical way of measuring the color of light. Also, whenever a hydrogen electron dropped only from the third energy level to the second energy level, it gave off a very low-energy red light with a wavelength of 656.3 nanometers.
 - These findings were so significant that the idea of the atom changed completely. What was once thought of as an almost random distribution of electrons became the idea that electrons only have specific locations where they can be found. This is where the idea of electron configurations and quantum numbers began.
 - (The Bohr Model replaced the Rutherford model which was prevalent at the time, for which the Rutherford engine designed by Rocket Lab is named.)
 - We now know that when the hydrogen electrons get excited, they're going to emit very specific colors depending on the amount of energy that is lost by each. This also happens in elements with atoms that have multiple electrons. However, because each element has a different electron configuration and a slightly different structure, the colors that are given off by each element are going to be different. Each element is going to have its own distinct color when its electrons are excited - or its own atomic spectrum. That's what causes different colors of fireworks! For example, when copper is burned, it produces a bluish-greenish flame. When sodium is burned, it produces a yellowish-golden flame. When magnesium is burned, it releases photons that are so high in energy that it goes higher than violet and emits an ultraviolet flame.
