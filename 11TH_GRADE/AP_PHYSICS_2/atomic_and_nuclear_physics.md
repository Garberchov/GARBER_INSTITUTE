#### Planck's Constant
 - Planck's constant is a number that describes the size of the energy packets (or 'quanta') that are contained within light. These packets of energy are called photons. Planck's constant is given the symbol h in physics and numerically is equal to $6.63 x 10^-34$ Joule seconds.
 - Towards the end of the 19th century, Planck was working to understand black-body radiation -- a kind of radiation that would be emitted by a perfect absorber and emitter of radiation. This is very close to the kind of radiation we receive from the sun. Planck successfully created an equation to describe black-body radiation, but then realized his solution was one of many, which could lead to many different values of energy produced.
 - In a last-ditch attempt to make his ideas work, he proposed that the energy of light was not a continuous quantity -- you couldn't just have absolutely any value of energy. Rather, light must contain packets of energy of a particular size. Although it was an act of desperation, he turned out to be right and won a Nobel Prize in 1918 for his work.
 - While Planck's constant can now be found in many equations, the equation that defines Planck's constant is called the Planck-Einstein relation, and it looks like this: E = hf.
 - Here, E is the energy of each packet (or 'quanta') of light, measured in Joules; f is the frequency of light, measured in hertz; and h is of course Planck's constant. So the constant describes how to take the frequency (or color) of light and use it to determine the size of the packets of energy (or photons) it contains.
 - It's a pretty straight-forward equation, but one that was part of a revolution in physics. Understanding the existence of these 'quanta' led over the following few decades to the development of quantum mechanics, a topic that has revolutionized physics and, in turn, led to huge advances in the world.

#### The Bohr Model and Atomic Spectra
 - We're going to start off this lesson by focusing on just the hydrogen atom because it's a simple atom with a very simple electronic structure. It only has one electron which is located in the 1s orbital. Recall from a previous lesson that 1s means it has a principal quantum number of 1. This means it's in the first and lowest energy level, and because it is in an s orbital, it will be found in a region that is shaped like a sphere surrounding the nucleus.
 - All we are going to focus on in this lesson is the energy level, or the 1 (sometimes written as n=1). This little electron is located in the lowest energy level, called the ground state, meaning that it has the lowest energy possible. When you write electron configurations for atoms, you are writing them in their ground state.
 - So, if this electron is now found in the ground state, can it be found in another state? Absolutely. If this electron gets excited, it can move up to the second, third or even a higher energy level. But what causes this electron to get excited? Adding energy to an electron will cause it to get excited and move out to a higher energy level. The more energy that is added to the atom, the farther out the electron will go. In a later lesson, we'll discuss what happens to the electron if too much energy is added.
 - A couple of ways that energy can be added to an electron is in the form of heat, in the case of fireworks, or electricity, in the case of neon lights. When these forms of energy are added to atoms, their electrons take that energy and use it to move out to outer energy levels farther away from the nucleus.
 - Now, those electrons can't stay away from the nucleus in those high energy levels forever. Eventually, the electrons will fall back down to lower energy levels. If the electrons are going from a high-energy state to a low-energy state, where is all this extra energy going? Energy doesn't just disappear.
 - As electrons transition from a high-energy orbital to a low-energy orbital, the difference in energy is released from the atom in the form of a photon. A photon is a weightless particle of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation comes in many forms: heat, light, ultraviolet light and x-rays are just a few. The most important feature of this photon is that the larger the transition the electron makes to produce it, the higher the energy the photon will have.
 - Think of this as kind of like an atomic version of what happens to satellites. Even though there is no "atmosphere" in outer space, small particles of dust and gasses will slowly decelerate the satellite requiring corrective burns to stay in orbit.
 - High-energy photons are going to look like higher-energy colors: purple, blue and green, whereas lower-energy photons are going to be seen as lower-energy colors like red, orange and yellow. Remember those colors of the rainbow - red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet? Those are listed in the order of increasing energy. Essentially, each transition that this hydrogen electron makes will correspond to a different amount of energy and a different color that is being released. This is called its atomic spectrum.
 - This led to the Bohr model of the atom, in which a small, positive nucleus is surrounded by electrons located in very specific energy levels. For example, whenever a hydrogen electron drops from the fifth energy level to the second energy level, it always gives off a violet light with a wavelength of 434.1 nanometers. A wavelength is just a numerical way of measuring the color of light. Also, whenever a hydrogen electron dropped only from the third energy level to the second energy level, it gave off a very low-energy red light with a wavelength of 656.3 nanometers.
 - These findings were so significant that the idea of the atom changed completely. What was once thought of as an almost random distribution of electrons became the idea that electrons only have specific locations where they can be found. This is where the idea of electron configurations and quantum numbers began.
 - (The Bohr Model replaced the Rutherford model which was prevalent at the time, for which the Rutherford engine designed by Rocket Lab is named.)
 - We now know that when the hydrogen electrons get excited, they're going to emit very specific colors depending on the amount of energy that is lost by each. This also happens in elements with atoms that have multiple electrons. However, because each element has a different electron configuration and a slightly different structure, the colors that are given off by each element are going to be different. Each element is going to have its own distinct color when its electrons are excited - or its own atomic spectrum. That's what causes different colors of fireworks! For example, when copper is burned, it produces a bluish-greenish flame. When sodium is burned, it produces a yellowish-golden flame. When magnesium is burned, it releases photons that are so high in energy that it goes higher than violet and emits an ultraviolet flame.

#### Wave-Particle Duality
 - Wave-particle duality is the idea that light and sub-atomic particles can behave both as waves but also as particles. Therefore, the two states are not mutually exclusive. A scientist called de Broglie introduced the idea in 1923, and it formed his doctoral dissertation.
 - This might be hard to imagine. How could light be both a wave AND a particle? And indeed, physicists found it difficult to accept, too. What we needed to be sure of wasn't just mathematics, but we needed actual experimental evidence. We already knew from the 19th century that light could behave as a wave -- that it exhibited reflection, refraction, and diffraction. These features couldn't be explained any other way. Then, Einstein's photoelectric effect experiment showed that light could also behave like a particle -- it turned out that light contains packets of energy, or 'quanta,' of a particular size. These days we call these packets 'photons.'
 - But that's just about light. To really pin down the more fundamental idea of wave-particle duality, we needed to also show that not only could light behave as a particle, but particles could also behave as waves.
 - In 1928, Clinton Davisson did exactly that in what would later be named the Davisson-Germer experiment. In his experiment, he fired electrons at a solid crystal lattice. Some electrons would reflect off the outermost layer of the crystal, while others would reflect off layers further inside the crystal. The electrons that reflected from the lattice were analyzed and turned out to have light and dark fringes in this pattern.
 - What did the pattern mean? Well, the electrons that bounced off different layers had interfered with each other, just like waves. By different electrons penetrating at different distances, this created a path difference between them. Wherever a peak met a peak or a trough met a trough, he saw a bright spot, called constructive interference. Where a peak met a trough, he saw a dark spot, called destructive interference. Electrons, it seemed, could behave as waves.

 - Now that it had been shown that particles and waves were one and the same thing, it was time to put some mathematics to it. De Broglie did this as part of his dissertation. He suggested that if something was a particle and a wave, then it must have both a wavelength (like a wave) and a momentum (like a particle), and that these things must be related to one another.
 - According to his equation, the de Broglie wavelength, or lambda, of an object or particle, measured in meters, would be equal to Planck's constant, h, which is just a number that is always equal to 6.63 x 10^-34, divided by the momentum of the object or particle, p, measured in kg m/s.
 - We can also expand on this by remembering the basic equation for momentum, an equation which states that the momentum of an object or particle is equal to the mass, measured in kilograms, multiplied by the velocity, measured in meters per second. 
 - We can try this experiment by calculating the wavelength of an everyday object. For example, a Mini Cooper. What is the wavelength of a 1,000 kilogram Mini Cooper moving at 30 m/s?
 - First of all, we should write out what we know. We have the mass, m, which is 1,000, and the velocity, v, which is 30. We also know that Planck's constant is always 6.63 x 10^-34. So, we can just divide 6.63 x 10^-34 by the momentum mv, which is 1,000 multiplied by 30. That gives us a wavelength of 2.21 x 10^-38. This is a minuscule number. Obviously, a Mini Cooper doesn't act as a wave, but it's a good way to get a feel for how the equation works. 

#### Nuclear Physics: Nuclear Force & Building Energy
 - These days, we know the masses of lots of particles. We know the masses of protons, neutrons and electrons. And we know the masses of most known elements in the periodic table.
 - But sometimes those numbers might seem to be hard to explain. It turns out that the total mass of the things an atom is made from, for example, 2 protons, 2 electrons and 2 neutrons, isn't the same as the mass of the atom itself. The mass of an atom isn't equal to the mass of its constituent parts. But how is that possible? On the face of it, this would seem to defy logic.
 - The reason is that when you put an atom together, energy is released. And conversely, when you take an atom apart, you have to expend energy to make it happen. Since energy and mass are really the same thing, this means that an assembled atom will have less mass than a disassembled atom. The difference between these two figures is called the mass defect, or in energy units, it's instead called the binding energy. It is defined as the energy required to disassemble a whole system into separate parts.
 - When nuclear reactions release energy, it is because there was a difference between the binding energy of the things you started with and the binding energy of the things you ended up with. If the things you end up with have less total binding energy, then energy will be released in the nuclear reaction.
 - It turns out that iron is the most stable atom in the periodic table - or in other words, it's the atom with the lowest energy state. Atoms lighter than iron release energy when they're fused together; this is called nuclear fusion. It happens in the Sun and other stars. Atoms heavier than iron release energy when they're broken apart, and this is called nuclear fission. It happens in nuclear power plants. This graph showing binding energy illustrates this. Any reaction that moves you closer to iron will release energy.
