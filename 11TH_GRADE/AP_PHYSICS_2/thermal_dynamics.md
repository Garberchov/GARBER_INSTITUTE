### Thermal Physics

#### Thermal Physics
 - In a nutshell, thermal physics is the study of heat. Heat energy, or thermal energy, is the energy of a substance or system in terms of the motion or vibrations of its molecules. The faster the molecules in a substance move the more heat energy they have.
 - If you wanted to know how much thermal energy there was in a glass of water, you would have to total up the energy of all the molecules inside it. Not only is this difficult to do, it isn't entirely helpful. A large glass of cold water has more heat energy than a small glass of cold water, but they feel just as cold. Because of this, we introduce a related term: temperature, which is the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. A large and small glass of water might have the same temperature, even though the large glass of water contains more overall heat energy.
 - Thermodynamics is the study of the movement of heat energy. This encompasses the laws of thermodynamics, which talk about how and why heat moves, the types of heat transfer (conduction, convection and radiation), phase (state) changes, and the relationship between energy and work. Studying thermodynamics also means talking about heat engines - how we can extract useful work using a combination of cold and hot reservoirs.
 - Kinetic theory is a simplified description of gases that describes how the molecules move and react to situations, predicting what will happen to the gas as a whole. Or in other words, it uses simple physical laws for the molecules that make up a gas to explain the way gases behave on everyday scales. Kinetic theory also defines terms like temperature (the average kinetic energy of gas molecules), pressure (the force exerted by the gas molecules on the walls of their container) and volume (the space the gas molecules take up). Kinetic theory not only defines these properties, but also their viscosity and thermal conductivity, all using the composition and motion of the molecules.
 - Last of all statistical mechanics takes kinetic theory a step further. It uses statistical probabilities to predict the likely behavior of the molecules in a system. Statistical mechanics rejects terms like temperature, pressure and volume, and shows how they arise from the statistical behavior of molecules. It is more powerful than kinetic theory, but also correspondingly more complex. However for most purposes, kinetic theory is sufficient.

#### Heat Transfer and Phase Changes
 - Heat energy, or thermal energy is the energy of a substance or system in terms of the motion or vibrations of its molecules. The faster the molecules in a substance move, the more heat energy they have. You can transfer heat energy from one object to another, and in fact, a heat transfer will occur naturally whenever a hotter object is in contact with a colder one; heat will always move from the hotter object to the colder one. For example, if you were to put your warm hands against a cold metal pole, the skin on your hands would feel cold. That's because the heat from your hands transfers to the cooler metal. Your hands feel colder because some of your heat has been transferred to the metal.
 - When you add heat energy to a substance, one of two things can happen: either the temperature of the substance will increase, or the phase (or state) of the substance will change. Temperature is the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. So it's pretty obvious why temperature might increase - heat is the motion of molecules, so if you get the molecules in a substance to move faster, then they'll have a higher temperature. But what about phase change?
 - Whereas temperature is the average kinetic energy of the molecules, the state is related to the spacing (or potential energy) of the molecules. Molecules that are further apart have more potential energy. Solids are substances with tightly-packed molecules in neat rows that can only move by vibrating. Liquids on the other hand are substances with molecules that can slide past one another and aren't as tightly packed as solids. Liquids do not have a consistent shape, and will change shape to fill the container. And gases are substances with molecules that are free to move in every direction. With a gas, not only does it not have a consistent shape, but it doesn't even have a consistent volume - the space it takes up can change.
 - Every phase change has a name: changing a solid to a liquid is called melting, changing a liquid to a gas is called boiling (or evaporating) , changing a gas to a liquid is called condensing, and changing a liquid to a solid is called freezing.
 - We can plot a graph to show the energy involved in phase changes: a graph of temperature plotted against heat added. It looks like this. As you can see, there are diagonal areas and flat areas. The diagonal areas are where heat is being added to increase the temperature. The flat areas are the phase changes, where heat is being added, but is going into the potential energy of the molecules, not the kinetic energy - the temperature therefore remains the same during these phase changes. These graphs and the equations that go with them are discussed in more detail in another lesson.

#### Thermal Expansion
 - The rate of heat transfer can be calculated, but there are separate equations for the three types of heat transfer. There's an equation to calculate heat transfer by conduction, one for convection, and one for radiation. But today we're just going to focus on conduction. The rate of heat transfer by conduction varies according to several factors: the thickness of the material through which it's transferring, the length of the material, and the temperature difference at the two ends of the material. In equation form, it looks like this:
 - $(Q / t) = [kA(delta T)] / d$
 - Here, Q over t is the heat transfer per second, measured in Joules per second, Q is the amount of heat energy (Joules), and t is the time in seconds. K (or to be exact, the Greek letter kappa) is the thermal conductivity of the material in watts per meter degrees C. A is the surface area of the material, d is the thickness of the material, and delta T is the difference in temperature between the two ends of the material, measured in either Celsius or Kelvin. Delta T is equal to the difference between the hottest temperature and the coldest.
 - Our understanding of thermal expansion is vitally important. It allows us to measure the temperature, stop bridges from collapsing, and open stubborn jars. Thermal expansion is where materials expand while being heated, causing them to take up more space. Some materials expand more than others - metals expand a lot, for example. But, in general, materials only expand due to the motion of their molecules. When something gets hotter, its molecules move faster. This is, after all, what temperature is: the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. Molecules that move faster use more space. So, materials contract when they cool, and they expand when you heat them up.
 - Okay, let's go back to the conduction equation and go through an example. Heat is being transferred through a metal of thermal conductivity 60 Watts per meter degrees C. The material has a surface area of 0.1 meters squared and a thickness of 0.05 meters. If one end of the material has a temperature of 20 degrees C and the other end has a temperature of 100 degrees C, what is the rate of heat transfer across the material? And how much heat will transfer in 42 seconds?
 - First of all, we should write down what we know. The thermal conductivity, kappa, is 60, the surface area A is 0.1, and the thickness d is 0.05. We can also find delta T by finding the difference in temperature between the two ends, which is 100 minus 20, which equals 80. We also have a time, t, of 42 seconds, but that's part of the second question.
 - The first question asks us to find the rate of heat transfer, which is Q over t, so all we have to do is plug numbers in and solve for Q over t. When we do that, we get a value of 9,600 Joules per second.
 - Then, the second question wants to know how much heat transfers in 42 seconds. Well, if 9,600 Joules of heat transfer every second, and we want to know how much transfers in 42 seconds, we just multiply. Multiplying 42 by 9,600 we get 403,200 Joules. Or, in other words, this is like solving for Q in the original equation, instead of Q over t you multiply both sides of the equation by t.

#### Calorimetry
 - Before we start to measure heat transfer, let me introduce you to two common units of heat or energy you will come across. Firstly, the calorie; this is defined as the amount of energy, or heat, required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one Celsius degree. The calorie is an old unit, but is still commonly used today. The calorie used to describe the amount of energy in food is actually a kilocalorie (which is 1,000 calories). So, our 500-calorie burger is really a 500,000-calorie burger!
 - The SI unit for heat is called the joule and is defined in terms of the calorie: 1 cal = 4.184 J. So, now our burger is equal to 500 kilocalories, 500,000 calories, and over 2 million joules! 
 - Now, we have already observed that different substances react differently when heated. It is also true that some substances require relatively large amounts of energy to change their temperatures, while others require relatively little. We call these differences 'heat capacity.' Specific heat capacity is the amount of energy required to change the temperature of one gram of a substance by one Celsius degree.
 - Q = s * m * change in temperature, where Q = heat (or energy), s is specific heat capacity, m is mass in grams, and delta T is the change in temperature in degrees Celsius.
