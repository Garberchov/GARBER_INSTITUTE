#### Electric Motors & Generators
 - Both motors and generators run because of something called electromagnetic induction. Discovered by Michael Faraday, this is when a voltage is induced by a changing magnetic field. With electromagnetic induction, an electric current can be produced in a coil of wire by moving a magnet in or out of that coil, or by moving the coil through the magnetic field. Either way, voltage is created through motion.
 - The amount of voltage induced depends on the number of loops in the coil of wire, as well as the speed at which the magnet is moved through the coil. A greater number of coils means a greater amount of voltage is induced. Similarly, the faster the magnet is moved through the coil, the more voltage you get.
 - What does this have to do with motors and generators? Well, a generator produces electricity by rotating a coil in a stationary magnetic field, and in a motor, a current is passed through a coil, which forces it to spin. 
 - Remember before how we said that a motor and a generator are the same device, but producing opposite results? What we mean here is that the flow of electricity is reversed, not that the machine itself operates in reverse. So, you can't just take a generator and turn it into a motor by 'reversing' the components of the machine. Likewise, with an electric motor you can't just flip a switch that makes the components operate in reverse to produce electricity. Instead, what you have to change is the direction the electricity flows: inward for a motor and outward for a generator.
 - When we're referring to AC and DC for motors and generators we're talking about alternating current and direct current. Like the name implies, alternating current alternates direction as it flows through a circuit. In contrast, direct current does not change direction as it flows through a circuit.
 - Motors and generators are generally either AC or DC. The type of current utilized in the device depends on whether you are more concerned with efficiency or cost. For example, AC motors and generators are more efficient, but also cost more. Most of the electronics you use, like your cell phone and tablet, rely on AC power because of its efficiency. Most hybrid and electric cars also use alternating current.

#### Electromagnetic Induction
 - In the early 19th century, a scientist by the name of Michael Faraday published several papers on electromagnetic induction, which is the ability of a changing magnetic field to induce a voltage in a conductor. To better understand this phenomenon, Faraday conducted a number of experiments. One of these experiments used a coil of wire, a permanent magnet and a device to detect voltage in the wire. When the magnet was passed through the coil of wire, a voltage was induced in the wire, but it disappeared when the magnet stopped moving. Faraday found that there were two factors that affected how much voltage was induced in the coil.
 - The first factor was the number of turns of wire in the coil, which increased the amount of wire exposed to the magnetic field. The results of Faraday's experiments showed that the induced voltage increased in direct proportion to the number of turns in the electrical coil. In other words, doubling the number of turns resulted in a doubling of the induced voltage.
 - The second factor was how quickly the magnetic field was changing. There are a couple of different ways that we can make a magnetic field change. One way is to change the strength of the field produced by the magnet. If we use an electromagnet to create the magnetic field, we can turn the magnet on and off or simply vary the current to change the strength of the field. The second way is to move the field relative to the conductor. We could do this by moving the coil around in the field or by moving the magnet around the coil - it doesn't matter which, as long as there is relative motion.
 - Faraday's Law came about as a result of his experiments. It simply states that the magnitude of the induced voltage is proportional to both the number of turns of wire and to the rate at which the magnetic field changes. One of the most important things to take away from this statement is that the induced voltage is the result of a changing magnetic field. In other words, simply holding a magnet stationary near a wire will not induce a voltage. The field must be changing in some way.

#### Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction
 - This discovery was so fundamental and important, that it is now known as Faraday's Law, which states that the amount of induced voltage is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux. This can be represented in equation form as:
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/farradayformula.jpg)
 - First we need to brush up on our Greek. For this law, we're going to use the Greek letter epsilon to represent the magnitude of the induced voltage, also known as EMF. This stands for 'electromotive force.' Think of it as the electric current caused by the motion of a force. It might also help to see that epsilon kind of looks like a cursive E for 'EMF'. Next is the letter delta, which means 'change in.' Finally we have phi, which represents the magnetic flux. This is simply the amount of magnetic field passing through a given surface area. In Faraday's case, the surface area was through the coil of wire he moved the magnet in and out of. Finally, the t on the bottom of the equation stands for 'time'.
 - Now that we know how to read Faraday's law, let's look at exactly what it means. We can tell by just looking at the equation, that the EMF and the magnetic flux are proportional because both are on top in the equation. This means that as one variable increases or decreases, the other variable will change in the same direction by the same amount. The change in time is on the bottom, so this means that it is inversely proportional to the EMF. The change here will be the opposite. As one variable increases or decreases, the other variable will change in the opposite direction by the same amount. As the change in flux increases, so does the EMF. But if the change in time increases, the EMF will decrease. Remember: 'delta' means 'change in,' so it's not the magnitude of the flux or the time, it's the magnitude of the change in either one of those variables that we're interested in.
 - Think of Delta V when remembering what Delta means.
 - We can use Faraday's coil wire to see how time affects the EMF as well. Moving the magnet very slowly through the loops of coil creates a small voltage because the change in time is very large. However, move that magnet through the loop quickly, and you create a large voltage because the change in time is very small. This shows us how these two are inversely proportional - as one goes up, the other goes down by the same amount. A large change in time (slow movement) means a small voltage is created, while a small change in time (fast movement) means a large voltage is induced. Thus, spinning a turbine VERY fast produces a lot of electricity, while spinning it VERY slowly produces very little electricity.

#### Magnetic Force: Definition, Poles & Dipoles
 - An easy thing to take for granted about magnets is that they always have a north pole and a south pole. Magnets are called dipoles, which literally means 'two poles.' If you could cut one end off the magnet and have just a north pole, then this single pole would be called a monopole. However, no one has ever been able to do this!
 - It turns out that every time you cut a magnet, you end up with a north pole and a south pole on each piece. Even if you could cut the magnet down to the size of just one atom, which would be really difficult, the atom would still have a north and a south pole, just like we saw before. A fundamental property of all magnets is that they only exist as dipoles in the natural world.
 - If you've ever played with magnets, then you definitely know that they exert an invisible force on each other. However, there is a very specific direction to these forces depending on which poles are near each other. Another fundamental property of magnets is that similar poles repel, while opposite poles attract. In other words, if you tried to bring the north poles of two magnets together, they would try to push each other away. The same thing would happen if you tried to bring the two south poles together. However, if you turned one magnet around and brought a north pole and a south pole together, then they would attract each other. 
 - Speaking of north and south poles, have you ever wondered where these names came from? If you thought of the Earth, then you're on the right track.
 - The compass is the oldest application of magnetic materials. Well before magnets were understood, it was known that a naturally magnetic material, such as lodestone, would rotate to align itself in a north-south orientation relative to the Earth. The end of the lodestone that pointed toward the north was called the 'north' pole and the other end, the 'south' pole. The reason the lodestone would align this way was because the Earth itself acted like a giant magnet, which attracted the opposite poles of the lodestone.
