#### Electric Motors & Generators
 - Both motors and generators run because of something called electromagnetic induction. Discovered by Michael Faraday, this is when a voltage is induced by a changing magnetic field. With electromagnetic induction, an electric current can be produced in a coil of wire by moving a magnet in or out of that coil, or by moving the coil through the magnetic field. Either way, voltage is created through motion.
 - The amount of voltage induced depends on the number of loops in the coil of wire, as well as the speed at which the magnet is moved through the coil. A greater number of coils means a greater amount of voltage is induced. Similarly, the faster the magnet is moved through the coil, the more voltage you get.
 - What does this have to do with motors and generators? Well, a generator produces electricity by rotating a coil in a stationary magnetic field, and in a motor, a current is passed through a coil, which forces it to spin. 
 - Remember before how we said that a motor and a generator are the same device, but producing opposite results? What we mean here is that the flow of electricity is reversed, not that the machine itself operates in reverse. So, you can't just take a generator and turn it into a motor by 'reversing' the components of the machine. Likewise, with an electric motor you can't just flip a switch that makes the components operate in reverse to produce electricity. Instead, what you have to change is the direction the electricity flows: inward for a motor and outward for a generator.
 - When we're referring to AC and DC for motors and generators we're talking about alternating current and direct current. Like the name implies, alternating current alternates direction as it flows through a circuit. In contrast, direct current does not change direction as it flows through a circuit.
 - Motors and generators are generally either AC or DC. The type of current utilized in the device depends on whether you are more concerned with efficiency or cost. For example, AC motors and generators are more efficient, but also cost more. Most of the electronics you use, like your cell phone and tablet, rely on AC power because of its efficiency. Most hybrid and electric cars also use alternating current.
