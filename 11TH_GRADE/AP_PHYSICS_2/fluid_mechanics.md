#### Fluids in Physics
 - Liquids and gases are more similar to each other because, unlike solids, they both conform to the shape of their container. They also both flow when moved around, and any material that flows is called a fluid. When you put air in your car tires, they stay inflated because the gas particles fill the entire space inside. Likewise, when you fill your bathtub, you can't keep the water on just one side because it flows to cover all the space of the tub.
 - There are certain properties that fluids share, though the specifics of these may be slightly different for each type of fluid. The main difference between the two fluids mentioned here is that gas particles are much farther apart than the particles of a liquid. Both will spread out to fill their container, but a liquid only does so beneath its surface.
 - This important difference helps us understand that a gas is compressible, which means its volume can easily be increased or decreased, while a liquid is incompressible, meaning its volume cannot easily be changed. In other words, you can more easily press gas particles together than you can the particles of a liquid. This is because there is more space between those gas particles, while the liquid particles are already about as close together as they can get.
 - One property that all fluids do share is that they have density. This is simply the amount of matter in a given space for that substance. Another way of saying this is that the density is the amount of matter per unit volume, or in equation form: density = mass/volume.
 - Pressure is another important characteristic of fluids. This is the force exerted over a given area. There are many different units that can be used to express pressure, like pounds per square inch (psi), millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and Newton per meter squared (N/m^2). It all depends on the force and the area you're measuring.
 - In the case of a liquid, the pressure is exerted by the weight of the fluid and the weight of the air above it.
 - Buoyancy is another common characteristic of fluids. This is the upward force from a fluid, which is usually felt by some object in that fluid. You float in a pool because of buoyancy, and a hot air balloon rises into the sky - also because of buoyancy.
 - Buoyancy in a fluid comes from the pressure of the fluid itself. An object submerged in a fluid experiences pressure from all sides. But since the pressure from below is greater (because that part of the object is deeper), it creates an unbalanced force on the object and it's pushed upward, lifting it in the fluid and against the force of gravity.
 - Viscosity is yet another important property of fluids. Remember how I said that all fluids flow? Well, viscosity describes the resistance of a fluid to flow. Thicker fluids are more viscous than thinner ones because they don't flow as easily. For example, honey is a very viscous fluid because it flows very slowly, whereas water is not as viscous because it flows more easily.
 - The viscosity of a fluid changes with temperature, and this is where things get really interesting. Increasing the temperature decreases the viscosity of liquids (making them flow more easily), but increases the viscosity of gases (making them flow less easily). This is because the particles in a gas are already moving around with a lot of space between them, making it easy for them to flow.
 - One property of liquids that is quite special is surface tension. This forms a thin layer where a liquid and another fluid meet. A thin film forms on the surface of the liquid (hence the name surface tension), and you can definitely try this one at home! Take a penny and an eyedropper and slowly put one drop of water at a time on top of the penny. You'll notice that the water builds up in a dome instead of spilling right off of the penny, and this is because of the surface tension of the water against the air. This same property allows for other fascinating events, such as insects walking across a pond or a leaf floating on top of a lake.

#### What is Density
 - Density is a measure of how compact the mass in a substance or object is. The density of an object or substance can be calculated from this equation: density in kilograms per meter cubed is equal to mass in kilograms, divided by volume in meters cubed. Or in other words, density is mass spread out over a volume. Or in other, other words, it's the number of kilograms that 1 meter cubed of the substance weights. If each meter cubed weighs more, the substance is more dense.
 - As we'll discuss in other lessons, density is super important because it relates to whether things rise or sink. Less dense materials tend to rise above more dense materials, particularly in the case of liquids and gases. So understanding density has major implications for the motions of materials and gases in the atmosphere and objects floating (or sinking) in water. Density is the reason some objects sink and other objects float. And it's the reason that some clouds are high in the sky, while others are low down.
