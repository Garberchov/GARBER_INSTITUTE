### Potential and Capacitance

##### Electric Potential Energy
 - Electric potential energy is the energy a charge has due to its position relative to other charges. If you take a ball with mass m and raise it to any height, you are giving it gravitational potential energy. We know this for two reasons: one, you have to use energy in your muscles to do it, and two, when you let go of the ball, it falls to the ground and that energy is released again.
 - Electric potential energy is similar but with charges instead of masses. Instead of raising a ball in the gravitational field of the Earth, you move a charge that's in the electric field of another charge. By separating two charges to a radius r, you are giving the charges electric potential energy relative to each other. When you release those charges, they will attract or repel, releasing that energy. Opposite charges will attract, just like the Earth and the ball. Like charges will repel.
 - The point where an object has zero potential is an arbitrary value. You can choose it to be wherever you want. This is like how we often measure gravitational potential energy relative to the ground, even though if you moved the ground, a ball would continue to fall until it reached the center of the Earth.
 - The equation for electric potential looks like this. Here, U is the electric potential energy between two charges, measured in Joules, big Q is the charge of one of the charges, measured in Coulombs, little q is the charge of the other charge, measured in Coulombs, epsilon-zero is a constant, which is always equal to 8.85 x 10^-12, and r is the distance (or radius) between the charges, measured in meters.

#### Finding the Electric Potential Difference Between Two Points
 - The electric potential at a particular point in space is the work done in moving a positive charge from infinity to that point. The electric potential at infinity is defined as zero. It is related to the electric potential energy in that electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge.
 - So, if a four coulomb charge has 4,000 Joules of electric potential energy due to its position in an electric field, that would mean that the electric potential at that point in the field is 1,000 Joules per coulomb - each coulomb has a thousand Joules of electric potential energy. Whereas electric potential energy is specific to a particular charge, electric potential is defined only by a position inside a field. This makes it a much more useful quantity.
 - Let's imagine we have two parallel plates: one with a positive charge and one with a negative charge. In electromagnetism, we use a positive charge to define electric fields. So we'll focus on what happens to a positive charge inside the plates. If you release a positive charge on the negative plate, it won't go anywhere because opposites attract. But, if you release it on the positive plate, it will follow the field lines and 'fall' to the negative plate. So when we talk about electric fields, we say that the field lines point in the direction of decreasing electric potential.
 - And now, finally, that brings us to electric potential difference. Electric potential difference is the difference in electric potential between two points in space. That's really all it is. It is also measured in Joules per coulomb, but this is usually shortened to a different unit: volts. The electric potential difference between two sides of a battery is what makes electricity flow around a circuit. A 12V battery, for example, has a difference in potential of 12 Joules per coulomb on the two sides of the battery.
 - In a uniform electric field, the equation to calculate the electric potential difference is super easy: V = Ed. In this equation, V is the potential difference in volts (or Joules per coulomb), E is the electric field strength in the area (in newtons per coulomb), and d is the distance between the two plates (in meters).
 - The parallel plates situation I mentioned earlier is an example of a uniform electric field. Between the plates the field lines are equally spaced, so the field has the same strength everywhere - it's uniform. If we wanted to figure out the potential difference between the plates, we could take the electric field between the plates, E, and just multiply it by the distance between the plates. Strictly speaking, this distance, d, should always be in the direction of the field lines (if you move left and right on this diagram, the electric potential doesn't actually change at all).
 - It's time to go through an example. Let's say you connect a parallel plate capacitor to a 12V battery. Once the capacitor is fully charged, an electric field of 10 newtons per coulomb is created between the plates. What must the distance between the plates be?
 - First of all, we should write out what we know. We know that the voltage, V, is 12 volts. We know that the electric field, E, is 10 newtons per coulomb. And we're asked to find d, the distance between the plates. We know this because if you connect a 12V battery to parallel plates, that will produce a potential difference of 12 volts between the two plates.
 - So all we have to do is plug in our numbers, rearrange for d, and solve. When we do that, we get 1.2 meters. And that's it - that's our answer.

#### Ohm's Law
 - The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is described by Ohm's law. This equation, i = v/r, tells us that the current, i, flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage, v, and inversely proportional to the resistance, r. In other words, if we increase the voltage, then the current will increase. But, if we increase the resistance, then the current will decrease. We saw these concepts in action with the garden hose. Increasing the pressure caused the flow to increase, but getting a kink in the hose increased the resistance, which caused the flow to decrease.
 - The way the equation is written here, it would be easy to use Ohm's law to figure out the current if we know the voltage and the resistance. But, what if we wanted to solve for the voltage or the resistance instead? One way to do this would be to rearrange the terms of the equation to solve for the other parameters, but there's an easier way. The diagram above will give us the appropriate equation to solve for any unknown parameter without using any algebra. To use this diagram, we simply cover up the parameter we're trying to find to get the proper equation. This will make more sense once we start using it, so let's do some examples. 
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/parameter-diagram.png)
 - Next, let's increase the voltage to see what happens to the current. We'll use the same light bulb but switch to a 20-volt battery. Using the same equation as before, we divide 20 volts by 20 ohms and we get 1 amp of current. As we can see, doubling the voltage caused the current to double as well. This makes sense when we think about the garden hose. If we increased the pressure in the hose, we would expect the flow of water to increase as well. It's always good to double-check your work by asking if the results match what you expected to happen.
 - If we increased the resistance of the light bulb, what would you expect to happen to the current? To find out, let's swap out our existing bulb with a different one that has a resistance of 40 ohms. Since we're still looking for the current, we use the same equation as before. Dividing 20 volts by 40 ohms gives us one half-ampere of current. This result tells us that doubling the resistance reduced the current by half. Is this what you expected? Thinking back to our hose, it makes sense that putting a kink in the hose would reduce the water flow, just like increasing the resistance in the circuit would reduce the current.
 - Thus far, we've only calculated the current in the circuit, but what if someone had swapped out our light bulb when we weren't looking and we needed to figure out the resistance of the new one? Well, we know the voltage of our battery is 20 volts, and we can measure the current in the circuit with a tool called an ammeter, so all that's left is to do some math. Using our diagram, we cover up the parameter that we're trying to find, which is the resistance, r. The diagram now shows us that we need to divide the voltage by the current. If our ammeter measured a current of 5 amperes flowing through the circuit, then the resistance is equal to 20 volts divided by 5 amperes, which is 4 ohms
 - Finally, imagine that someone replaced our battery and we needed to figure out its voltage. The process is pretty much the same. We know our new bulb has 4 ohms of resistance, and we can measure the current in the circuit with the ammeter. Using the diagram, we cover up the voltage, v, which tells us that we need to multiply the current by the resistance. If the ammeter measured a current of 3 amperes, then the voltage would be 3 amperes multiplied by 4 ohms, which is 12 volts. That's all there is to it. By knowing any two of the three parameters, we can always calculate the third by using Ohm's law.

#### Voltage Sources
 - Voltage is the potential of a group of charged particles to do work in a circuit. In practical terms, this means that electrons at a higher voltage will spin a motor faster than electrons at a lower voltage.Voltage acts a lot like pressure in a water pipe, pushing more electrons.
 - Batteries have two electrodes, and in between them is a chemical reaction that produces electrons. The electrons flow from the negative electrode to the positive electrode, and this flow of electrons is called current. In order to continue the flow, we must continue the flow by running a wire from the positive electrode back to the negative, and along the way we can do useful work by lighting a light bulb or running a motor. 
 - These voltage sources can be used for many things, one of which is electro-magnetic induction which is the ability of a changing magnetic field to exert force on charged particles.

#### Capacitance
 - Capacitors are an electric device relatively few people know about. But that might be considered surprising, particularly when you realize that practically every electronic device will contain capacitors of some kind. A capacitor is a component that stores charge (stores electrical energy) until it gets full and then releases it in a burst.
 - Capacitors really are used everywhere: from computers to televisions to high-band pass filters to car starters. Almost every electronic device you use contains capacitors. And the title of this lesson: capacitance is a measure of a capacitor's ability to store charge, measured in farads; a capacitor with a larger capacitance will store more charge.
 - The definition of capacitance is given by this equation: capacitance C, measured in farads, equals charge Q, measured in coulombs, divided by voltage V, measured in volts. So, for example, if you connect a 12V battery to a capacitor, and that battery charges the capacitor with 4 coulombs of charge, it must have a capacitance of 4/12, which is 0.33 farads.

 - If the capacitor had a higher capacitance, it would store more charge when connected to the same battery. Because of this equation, we can see that capacitance is, therefore, measured in coulombs per volt. So, it represents how many coulombs of charge will be stored in a capacitor per volt you put across it.
 - Okay, but what physically makes a particular capacitor actually have a different capacitance? What decides how much charge it stores? Well, that's based on the actual physical characteristics of the capacitor. So, we have another equation for capacitance that looks like this:
 - The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor, a simple capacitor that is just two parallel plates separated by a distance, d, is equal to the relative permittivity of the material between the places, K, multiplied by the permittivity of free space, epsilon-zero, which is always equal to 8.854 * 10^-12, multiplied by the area of the plates, A, measured in meters squared, divided by the distance between the places, d, measured in meters.
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/capacitanceeq.jpg)
 - Most of that is pretty self-explanatory, but K, the relative permittivity of the so-called 'dielectric' material between the plates is generally either equal to 1 or larger. If there's nothing between the plates, K = 1; if it's air between the plates, then K is pretty much still equal to 1; and if it's a different material, it will be a number greater than one, depending on the exact material.
