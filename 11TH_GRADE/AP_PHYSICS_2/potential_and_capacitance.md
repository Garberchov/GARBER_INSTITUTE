##### Electric Potential Energy
 - Electric potential energy is the energy a charge has due to its position relative to other charges. If you take a ball with mass m and raise it to any height, you are giving it gravitational potential energy. We know this for two reasons: one, you have to use energy in your muscles to do it, and two, when you let go of the ball, it falls to the ground and that energy is released again.
 - Electric potential energy is similar but with charges instead of masses. Instead of raising a ball in the gravitational field of the Earth, you move a charge that's in the electric field of another charge. By separating two charges to a radius r, you are giving the charges electric potential energy relative to each other. When you release those charges, they will attract or repel, releasing that energy. Opposite charges will attract, just like the Earth and the ball. Like charges will repel.
 - The point where an object has zero potential is an arbitrary value. You can choose it to be wherever you want. This is like how we often measure gravitational potential energy relative to the ground, even though if you moved the ground, a ball would continue to fall until it reached the center of the Earth.
 - The equation for electric potential looks like this. Here, U is the electric potential energy between two charges, measured in Joules, big Q is the charge of one of the charges, measured in Coulombs, little q is the charge of the other charge, measured in Coulombs, epsilon-zero is a constant, which is always equal to 8.85 x 10^-12, and r is the distance (or radius) between the charges, measured in meters.
