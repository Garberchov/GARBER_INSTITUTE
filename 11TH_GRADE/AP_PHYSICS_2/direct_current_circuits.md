#### Kirchhoff's Laws
 - Kirchhoff developed two rules, or laws, regarding circuits. The first of Kirchhoff's rules states that the sum of the currents entering a junction must equal the sum of the currents leaving the junction. Because this law deals with the current at junctions in the circuit, it's also sometimes called Kirchhoff's current law or Kirchhoff's junction rule. All this law is saying is that we have a conservation of charge - the current may split and go in different directions at the junction, but if you added up the total amount of current in each branch they would equal the amount of current that originally came into that junction.
 - The second of Kirchhoff's rules states that the algebraic sum of the voltage differences across all elements of a closed loop must equal zero. This rule is based on the law of conservation of energy, and reminds us that as current encounters a resistor there's a 'voltage drop' and that the sum of all voltage drops is equal to the total supplied voltage. Since this rule deals with voltage across loops in the circuit, it's also sometimes called Kirchhoff's voltage law or Kirchhoff's loop rule.
 - So, now that you know what Kirchhoff's rules are, let's look at how you might use them to help you analyze a more complicated circuit. Say, for example, that you have a complex circuit like this:
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/complexcircuit.jpg)
 - Here, we use the letter I to represent current, the letter R to represent resistance, and the letter E to represent the power supply. You can tell by the arrows which way the current is flowing and, in some cases, how much current is flowing in that direction.
 - But, let's say that some part of the current flow is unknown. We can use Kirchhoff's first rule, the current law, to help us. In this circuit, we can see that 15A enters junction A, and that 7A goes through the right branch toward Resistor 2. How much current flows toward Resistor 3? We simply find the difference between the left branch and the total incoming current. Therefore, I1 - I2 = I3, or 15A - 7A = 8A.
 - It works the same no matter how many incoming sources of power or outgoing branches you have. If, for example, you have the type of junction where there are two sources of incoming current and three exit paths for the current to flow through, your equation would look like this: I1 + I2 = I3 + I4 + I5.

 - And, if you know how much current is leaving the junction in each branch, but only know how much is coming in from one of the branches, say I2, simply rearrange your equation so that you get that unknown value by itself. Then, solve for I3 + I4 + I5 - I2 = I1, and you'll get your answer!
 - The total loss of voltage around a circuit loop will equal the total voltage of the power supply. So, if you have a 12V battery powering the circuit and you have three resistors along that circuit, you'll have a total loss of 12V across the resistors. In contrast, as current flows through the power supply, it passes from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, and there's a 'voltage rise,' or increase in voltage. Again, this will be the same voltage as the power supply.
 - Let's apply this idea to a simple circuit to see how we would use Kirchhoff's second rule for circuit voltage analysis. In this circuit, we have a power supply of 100V and four resistors, three of which have known values of voltage loss: 25V, 30V, and 15V.
 - Just doing the basic math on this one, 25+30+15=70, and 100-70=30. So, we know that the fourth resistor, R4, must have a voltage loss of 30V. 
 
#### Electrical Resistance
 - 'Resistivity' sounds an awful lot like 'resistance,' but they're actually two different things. Resistivity is a property of the material an object is made of, whereas resistance is affected by several other characteristics of the object. Every material has some electrons that are free to move around between atoms and other electrons that are tightly bound to the atoms. When the free electrons try to flow through the conductor, they tend to collide with the outermost electrons of the atoms, which impedes their movement. Materials with more of the tightly bound electrons, and therefore fewer free electrons, have a higher resistivity.
 - Resistivity is one of the factors that affects an object's overall resistance, but the dimensions of the object also play a role. The resistance of a wire in particular is greatly affected by its length and diameter. Increasing the length of a wire increases its resistance because the electrons will experience more collisions as they flow from one end to the other.
 - On the other hand, the resistance of a wire decreases as its diameter gets larger because the electrons have more cross-sectional area to move through, which decreases the chance of collisions. When the temperature of a conductor is increased, the atoms start to vibrate from the added heat energy. They move ever so slightly in all directions, causing more collisions to occur with the free electrons trying to get by. As the temperature rises, so does the size of the vibrations and therefore the number of collisions.

#### Parallel Circuits
 - Circuits come in two basic forms. The first is a series circuit, which connects devices in series. This type of circuit provides a single pathway for electron movement. The second type is a parallel circuit, which connects devices along branched pathways. This type of circuit provides separate paths for the electrons to flow. 
 - Parallel circuits get their name because the devices along the circuit are connected in parallel. This is like having multiple X-ray screening stations in the same airport terminal. The line initially begins as single-file, but then breaks into multiple, separate lines as you go through your X-ray machine of choice. Others behind you may choose to go through a different X-ray machine, and the number of lines that form depends on how many machines are open. After going through the X-ray machine, everyone merges back together into the same line and continues along the path to their gate.
 - Just as each X-ray machine line is independent of the others, the devices in a parallel circuit are also independent of each other. Think about it: if the next line over moves more slowly than yours, it has no effect on how quickly or slowly your lines moves. The same is true for parallel circuit branches. And because of this independence, while the total current in the circuit is divided among the parallel branches, the amount of current in each branch is specifically related to the amount of resistance in that branch.
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/parallel_circuits1.png)
 - The resistance comes from the device itself and is an opposition to electron movement through the device. Because resistance opposes the movement of current, the amount of current in each branch is inversely proportional to the resistance of that branch.
 - The more resistance in an individual branch, the more opposition the current faces as it travels through. But, as the number of branches is increased, the overall resistance of the circuit is decreased. This makes sense as the total potential throughput of the circuit is increased. The more branches you have, the more current can flow through the circuit.

#### Resistor Capacitor (RC) Circuits:
 - RC circuits are really cool because instead of a steady flow of current, an RC circuit is one in which the current varies over time.
 - The circuit has a battery, a capacitor, a resistor, and a switch that opens and closes the circuit. When the switch is open there is no current flowing through the circuit so the capacitor does not discharge to the resistor.
 - If we close the switch and complete the circuit, this allows current to flow and the capacitor to discharge through the resistor.
 - What's key here is that the discharge of the capacitor is not linear, it's exponential. This means that while the rate of decay is constant, the amount of decay is proportional to its current value and changes over time.
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/7397635c-d877-4562-b382-fe723b8800b6_untitled.png)
 - We call the rate of decay of current and voltage the time of decay. This value is represented by the constant τ, which is equal to R*C and is measured in seconds.
 - This time constant tells you a lot about how charging or discharging will occur in an RC circuit. For example, if you have a large capacitor that can hold more charge, it will take a longer time to charge or discharge it so your time constant τ = R*C will be larger. On the other hand, if your time constant τ = R*C is smaller, this means that you have a faster decay.
 - The two sides of the equation are proportional. This means that when one component increases, say the resistance or the capacitance, the other side, the time decay, must increase as well to keep both sides equal. Likewise, if the capacitance or resistance decreases, the decay rate will as well.
 - In any circuit, including RC circuits, the voltage of a battery is a constant. You can't change it without changing the battery itself. And since we're looking at a series circuit, the voltage of the battery is also equal to the voltage across the resistor, plus the voltage across the capacitor. The voltage across the resistor is equal to IR, the current through the resistor, I, measured in amps, multiplied by the resistance of the resistor, R, measured in ohms. And the voltage across the capacitor is equal to Q over C, where Q is the charge on the capacitor measured in coulombs, and C is the capacitance of the capacitor in farads. We're going to call this the RC voltage equation. As the capacitor charges, the charge Q will increase, and so the current I must decrease to compensate. This is because the voltage of the battery must be constant.
 - ![Alt text](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/fb692529-23e2-4ae5-a351-67f36c52cb3e_voltage.jpg)
 - This reflects what we see: as a capacitor charges, the current in the circuit slows until it nears zero. At this point the circuit has reached a steady state. The capacitor is fully charged and ready to be discharged by connecting it to another circuit component in a complete loop.
 - Well, when you first close the switch and start the charging process, the charge on a capacitor, Q, equals zero, and the voltage across the resistor will therefore be equal to the voltage of the battery. To find the current flowing through the circuit, just use V=IR, where V is the voltage of the battery, and R is the resistance of the resistor, and solve for I.
 - At the end, when the capacitor is fully charged, the current has gradually reduced and is approaching zero. Since the current is zero, the 'IR' part of the RC voltage equation is equal to zero. So the voltage across the capacitor must be equal to the voltage of the battery.

#### Series Circuits
 -  A series circuit connects devices in series, providing one single pathway for electron movement. 
 - This is true for a series circuit as well, but the terms are reversed. A closed circuit is a circuit with current flowing through it, and an open circuit is a circuit with no current. We say the 'circuit' is closed or open, but really we're talking about a switch being closed or open. If the switch is open, the loop isn't connected, so there's no current. But if we close the switch, we complete the circuit by closing the loop so current can move through it.
 - Closing or opening the circuit is as simple as flipping a light switch. When you flip the switch to the 'ON' position, this completes the circuit and closes the loop, supplying current to your ceiling lights. When you flip the switch to the 'OFF' position, you open the circuit and no current flows through to the lights.
 - We can construct a simple series circuit with a battery and a few light bulbs. When the switch is closed, the circuit has current and the light bulbs light up. The current flows through each bulb from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal. And because there's only one pathway, the current is the same in every part of the circuit, even the battery.
 - But what happens if you break the circuit? The flow of electrons stops and there is no longer any current in the circuit. If you open the switch or one of the bulbs goes out, the whole circuit is affected. This is the same reason why a string of Christmas tree lights won't work if only one of the bulbs is burned out - they're all connected in series, so the current stops flowing to the rest of the bulbs as well.
 - This is because each light bulb provides resistance to the current. This is an opposition of electron movement through the device. As it encounters each bulb, the current is resisted by the resistance of each bulb and has less energy as it travels to the next one.
 - The current in a series circuit is also related to the voltage supplied by the battery or other source. Specifically, the current is directly proportional to the voltage across the circuit and inversely proportional to the resistance. This relationship is known as Ohm's law, discovered by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm.
 - This relationship makes sense if you think about it. Just like your heart pumps blood through your body, a battery produces voltage that 'pumps' current through the circuit. Therefore, more voltage means more current. In contrast to this, just like a clogged artery opposes the flow of blood, resistance opposes the flow of current. Therefore, as resistance increases, current decreases.
 - As current encounters a resistor, there is a 'voltage drop,' which creates a unique situation in a series circuit. Along a series of devices, the total voltage across the circuit is divided among each resistor so that the sum of each voltage drop is equal to the total supplied voltage.

#### electric current
 - There are two different types of current in widespread use today. They are direct current, abbreviated DC, and alternating current, abbreviated AC. In a direct current, the electrons flow in one direction. Batteries create a direct current because the electrons always flow from the 'negative' side to the 'positive' side.
 - Alternating current, abbreviated AC, pushes the electrons back and forth, changing the direction of the flow several times per second. In the United States, the current changes direction at a rate of 60 hertz, or 60 times in one second. The generators used in power plants to produce electricity for your home are designed to produce alternating current. You've probably never noticed the lights in your house actually flicker as the current changes direction because it happens too fast for our eyes to detect.
 - So, why do we need two types of current, and which one is better? Well, that's a good question, and the fact that we're still using both types of current should tell you that they both serve a purpose. Back in the 19th century, it was understood that to send power efficiently over the long distance between a power plant and a home, it had to be transmitted at a very high voltage. The problem was that sending really high voltage into a home was extremely dangerous for the people living there.
 - The solution to this problem was to reduce the voltage right outside the home before sending it inside. With the technology that existed at the time, it was much easier to reduce the voltage of AC than it was of DC, so AC won out as the preferred type of current. To this day, we still use AC for all of our long-distance power transmission, largely because of its ability to easily transform to other voltages.
 - So, why do we need DC at all? Well, first and foremost, it's important to realize that we currently don't have any way to store electrical energy. 'But, wait a minute!', you may say. 'What about batteries? Don't they store electrical energy?' Well actually, batteries convert electrical energy and store it as chemical energy. As we mentioned earlier, batteries only create DC, and in turn, can only be charged with DC. That means that AC must first be converted to DC before it can be used with a battery. Until an AC battery is invented, DC will always be a necessity.
