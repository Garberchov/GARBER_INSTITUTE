#### Kirchhoff's Laws
 - Kirchhoff developed two rules, or laws, regarding circuits. The first of Kirchhoff's rules states that the sum of the currents entering a junction must equal the sum of the currents leaving the junction. Because this law deals with the current at junctions in the circuit, it's also sometimes called Kirchhoff's current law or Kirchhoff's junction rule. All this law is saying is that we have a conservation of charge - the current may split and go in different directions at the junction, but if you added up the total amount of current in each branch they would equal the amount of current that originally came into that junction.
 - The second of Kirchhoff's rules states that the algebraic sum of the voltage differences across all elements of a closed loop must equal zero. This rule is based on the law of conservation of energy, and reminds us that as current encounters a resistor there's a 'voltage drop' and that the sum of all voltage drops is equal to the total supplied voltage. Since this rule deals with voltage across loops in the circuit, it's also sometimes called Kirchhoff's voltage law or Kirchhoff's loop rule.
 - So, now that you know what Kirchhoff's rules are, let's look at how you might use them to help you analyze a more complicated circuit. Say, for example, that you have a complex circuit like this:

 - Here, we use the letter I to represent current, the letter R to represent resistance, and the letter E to represent the power supply. You can tell by the arrows which way the current is flowing and, in some cases, how much current is flowing in that direction.
 - But, let's say that some part of the current flow is unknown. We can use Kirchhoff's first rule, the current law, to help us. In this circuit, we can see that 15A enters junction A, and that 7A goes through the right branch toward Resistor 2. How much current flows toward Resistor 3? We simply find the difference between the left branch and the total incoming current. Therefore, I1 - I2 = I3, or 15A - 7A = 8A.
 - It works the same no matter how many incoming sources of power or outgoing branches you have. If, for example, you have the type of junction where there are two sources of incoming current and three exit paths for the current to flow through, your equation would look like this: I1 + I2 = I3 + I4 + I5.

 - And, if you know how much current is leaving the junction in each branch, but only know how much is coming in from one of the branches, say I2, simply rearrange your equation so that you get that unknown value by itself. Then, solve for I3 + I4 + I5 - I2 = I1, and you'll get your answer!
 - The total loss of voltage around a circuit loop will equal the total voltage of the power supply. So, if you have a 12V battery powering the circuit and you have three resistors along that circuit, you'll have a total loss of 12V across the resistors. In contrast, as current flows through the power supply, it passes from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, and there's a 'voltage rise,' or increase in voltage. Again, this will be the same voltage as the power supply.
 - Let's apply this idea to a simple circuit to see how we would use Kirchhoff's second rule for circuit voltage analysis. In this circuit, we have a power supply of 100V and four resistors, three of which have known values of voltage loss: 25V, 30V, and 15V.
 - Just doing the basic math on this one, 25+30+15=70, and 100-70=30. So, we know that the fourth resistor, R4, must have a voltage loss of 30V.
