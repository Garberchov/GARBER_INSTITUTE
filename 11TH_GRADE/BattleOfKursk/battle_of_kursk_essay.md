### The Battle Of Kursk by David Glantz Book Report

The "Battle of Kursk" by David Glantz is an in-depth look at the greater political, strategic and operational context of the Battle of Kursk in 1943, an essential turning point in the Eastern Front of World War II. Glantz's look at the battle is unique in that it is not a narrative history, telling the story of the battle from the perspective of those on the ground and stitching them together into a coherent narrative. Instead, Glantz takes an analytical approach to the battle, looking at the battle from the top down and analyzing the different combatants's actions and decisions. This approach allows Glantz to provide a more comprehensive look at the battle, and to achieve a more nuanced view of the battle and the considerations that went into it. In this approach, Glantz goes out of his way to debunk many of the myths and misconceptions that have grown up around the battle, challenging popular narratives around reasons for the attack, why the Soviets won, and the role of individual actions across the front.  

Starting almost immediately, Glantz goes to great lengths to set up the stakes of the Battle of Kursk. Despite its smaller role in the history books compared to battles around Moscow and Stalingrad, both sides wagered a great deal on their operations in the Kursk area. Despite having little political or economic value, and little strategic value outside of the stretching of both armies' lines, the elimination of the Kursk salient was required to restore control of the front lines for the Germans and was a key in exploiting German weakness for the Soviets. The Germans absolutely needed a win at Kursk in order to boost flagging morale and whittle down the Soviet forces, which by this point were numerically superior in men and equipment. The Soviets were committed at Kursk because of the belief that the Germans were on the verge of total collapse, and that a victory at Kursk would grind down the German forces enough for massive Soviet offensives to follow much more easily. In Glantz's words, "Under the circumstances it was politically impossible for Germany to surrender the initiative on the Eastern Front. Although only fanatics believed that the Soviets could be decisively defeated, most senior leaders recognized the necessity for a renewed offensive."(Glantz 21). If the Germans rolled the dice and lost large portions of their army, the Soviets would be in a position to take the initiative and push the Germans back to the gates of Berlin.  

In the preparation phase of the battle, Glantz dispels the narrative that Hitler's meddling in pushing the attack from early May to July 5th due to his anxiety about the potential ramifications was singlehandedly responsible for the German defeat in the battle. Had Hitler believed in the superiority of his armies around the Kursk salient, as his original order implies, "This attack is of the utmost importance. It must be executed quickly. It must seize the initiative for us in the spring and summer. Therefore all preparations must be conducted with great circumspection and enterprise. The best formations, the best weapons, the best commanders and great stocks of ammunition must be committed in the main effort.. The enemy will be given no respite and will be destroyed by the prompt compression of the pocket."(Glantz 23), then a victory on the largely unprepared Soviets would have been assured, or so goes the historical narrative. This could not have been farther from the truth. Both armies were considerably weakened following the Battle of Stalingrad, and the Soviet offensives that created the Kursk salient. It would be irresponsible for any student of history to state that both the Soviets and Germans were in-shape for a confrontation the size of the Battle of Kursk, both sides needed time to recover and reorganize.

The myth of the German Wermacht(army) and Luftwaffe(Air Force) having overwhelming technical superiority during the Battle of Kursk, and throughout the war more generally, is one of the most enduring myths of the war. Glantz does not stray into the technicalities of various platforms, focusing more on the strategic and operational level of the battle, but he does provide a great deal of insight into the relative strengths of both sides numerically. While it is common knowledge that the Tiger and Panther tanks of the Germans were superior to the T-34 and KV tanks of the Soviets, they were deployed in extremely small numbers by this point in the war and the Panzer IVs that made up the majority of the German tank force were generally about equal to the T-34s(with major pros and cons of each vehicle). The main attack in the Northern sector of the salient was carried about by Walter Model's 9th Army. With 6 panzer, 1 panzer grenadier and fourteen infantry divisions they had between them 590 tanks, and 424 assault guns. Of these forces, some were very modern Tiger tanks and Ferdinand Tank Destroyers, but the vast majority were Sturmgesch√ºtz(commonly known as simply the Stug) III assault guns and Panzer III/IV tanks. Lined up on the southern sector of the bulge was the significantly stronger Army Group South, commanded by Erich von Manstein, consisting of the Fourth Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf. Added together, von Manstein controlled 6 Panzer, 5 Panzer Grenadier and assorted infantry divisions with 1269 tanks and 245 assault guns. These two forces were supported by the Sixth Air Fleet, led by General Ritter von Greim(a World War I ace), and the Fourth Air Fleet, commanded by General Otto Dessloch. While the numbers are hard to determine, approximately 1800 planes supported the German offensive on either edge of the salient. An overlooked part of the Luftwaffe contribution to the battle was a large number of anti-aircraft guns, taken from airfields to support the ground forces. According to Glantz, "More than 100 88mm guns provided direct support to the Ninth German Army, leaving the Luftwaffe with scant resources to defend airfields and other vital installations."(Glantz 54). This would prove to be an important factor, both in German tank-killing capabilities and in the success of Soviet Air Forces in their attacks on German airfields.

When the battle finally began in earnest, it was not through massive frontal assaults or large-scale pincers from coordinated tank and mechanized units, instead it was reconnaissance-in-force missions to destroy forwrad combat outposts and probe for weak-points in the Soviet lines. von Manstein's forces started this in the late afternoon of July 4th, with "Advanced battaltions of the 11th Panzer Division and from Grossdeutschland Division's Grenadier Regiment struck the outpot defenses of the Soviet 52d Guards Rifle Division's 3d Battalion, 151st Guards Rifle Regiment...the grenadiers suceeded in encirling most of the Soviet battalion and sweeping the remannts back from their forward positions."(Glantz 81). This individual action was indicative of the kind of fightiing that would rage across the entire Kursk battle, not divisions fighting each other but individual battalions and regiments locked in fierce struggles. More important than these small actions though, were the problems that would face the assembling German forces on the night of the 4th and early morning of 5th. These difficulties are described eloquently by Glantz, saying "Heavy thunder, violent lightning, and torrential rains bedeviled the assmembling German host. To make matters worse, Soviet artillery fire soon joined the cacphony of sound that announced the beginning of the Battle of Kursk...the assault wuld not surprise the Red Army."(Glantz 84). The existence of a prepared enemy, with significant field fortifications and a numerical superiority in troops and artillery, goes against fundamental doctrine of the use of armored forces - particularly for the Germans who didn't have the material wealth to support anything but extremely positive exchanmges of forces. Despite these significant problems, the Germans appeared to be making steady if not spectacular progress on the first days of the battle. By the end of the 5th, Model had broken through the first defensive belt in the North, a seemingly impressive result, however this victory was a pryhic one, as illustrated by Glantz, "about two-thirrds of the over 300 tanks and assault guns that the Germans commited to tbattle were put out of action due to enemy fire or mechnical failure... Model had lost at least 20 percent of his total armored striking power on the first day."(Glantz 91). Despite the matter of fact tone that Glantz takes in reporting this, it is a truly staggering statistic when considering how limited the force of the Germans was in comparison to the Soviets. The Germans were overwhelmingly outmatched materially and could only fall back on the superior training and tactical abilities of their crews. Even though some percentage of the crews would have escaped the loss of their tanks, many would have been lost and their simply weren't tanks to put them in to get them back into the fight. 

Despite Germnan losses in the early days of the Battle, the Soviets were not winning an overwhelming victory either. Due to Model's penetration of the first defensive belt in the North, the Soviets decided to immediately counterattack. This move, while speaking to the confidence and iniative of Soviet commanders, was ill-advised. Glantz illustrates this simply, "Considering the enormous residual power of the German offensive, the proposed counterattack was premature...fewer than 200 of 2d Tank Army's 465 tanks would see action on 6 July."(Glantz 93). The operational and communication issues that led to less than half of the Tank Forces being commited in the counterstroke doomed an offensive that could have been a minor defeat due to its premature nature,to causing dramatic material losses, made all the more unfortuante by these tanks being in prime positions-very close to the front-to be extremely useful in the continued defense of the Kursk Salient. As the battle continued, the German pincers in the north and south pushed depeer into the Soviet defenses and across the Soviet command, visions of the early encirclements of Kiev and Smolensk flashed through their minds. This fear was largely cast aside when Model's forces in the North failed to make a breakthrough, as Glantz says, "On 8th July the seesaw struggle also continued around Ponyri Station. At dawn the 307th Rifle Division counterattacked across terrain strewn with Soviet and German dead and the carcasses of tens of burned out tanks and smashed artillery pieces...Model stubbornly threw fresh troops into the struggle and Pukhov responded in kind...Through Herculean efforts and at immense cost, the Germans finally gained possesion of most, but not all, of Ponyri. The largely Pyrrhic victory left the victorious attackers exhausted and utterly incapable of further offensive action."(Glantz 120-121). The defeat of Model's forces, admittedly weaker than those in the South under von Manstein, ended any real hope of a decisive encirclement and operational freedom at Kursk. The fighting would continue in the South, with von Manstein and his forces making steady progress through Soviet lines, at immense cost, but never finding a way to break through. 

Even as the Germans drove towards Prokhorovka and Oboian, soundly defeating Soviet forces in tactical engagements, both the Germans and Soviet leadership made decisions that would prove fateful in the outcome of the battle. The German forces in the south, continually looking for a weakpoint in the Soviet defensive lines, found what they believed to be a weakpoint on the highway leading from Oboian to Kursk. In this effort however, the German forces were drawn in two direction and were steadily attrited by numerically superior Soviet forces. Near the Oboian road was General Katukov's 1st Tank Army, a force Glantz describes as "carefully forged for offensive maneuver, had become a hodgepodge of units, many of them badly depleted, commited to a desperate defense againsty the determiend German attacks."(Glantz 140) being used in defensive manner at odds with its original intention. However, in its continued stubborn defense of the Oboian highway, and its role in splitting the forces of von Manstein, the 1st Tank Army would prove instrumental in the tactical, and later strategic defeat of the Southern German pincer. The force facing the 1st Tank Army, leading by General Hermann Hoth, split even farther from Army detachment Kempf and even the 2nd SS Panzer Corps under Hausser. The steady loss of operational focus between the various forces under Von Manstein might not have been an issue during the early campaigns on the eastern front where the Germans had decisive aerial, tactical, and technological superiority but against a numerically superior foe with near equal air power and strongly entrenched positions, it would prove to be a fatal flaw. Despite this, the German forces under Hoth and Kempf did make progress on the 9th, however General Vatutin soon saw an opportunity to take a great deal of the punching power of the German forces away from them, as Glantz well illustrates, "Vatutin well understood the potential threat ot his plans posed by a continued avacne by Army Detachment Kempf and its III Panzer Corps. Therefore, it was imperative that Kempf's armor be contained."(Glantz 145). To do this, he issued simple orders to all forces facing von Manstein's forces in the South to stubbornly defend and attack the flanks of German spearheads such that nowhere along the front could they drive without being continually under fire. Vatutin was certainly aware that this kind of order was sure to be costly, but it was a surefire method of keeping the German armor in place. Due to this, the Germans in the South were fundamentally unable to make a decisive penetration of Soviet lines, and Kempf decided that the only way to force a breakthrough here was to change the direction of his assault, with eventually disastrous results. As Glantz simply illustrates, "Thwarted in the center and preoccupied with the threats to his flanks, he issued new orders to the II SS Panzer Corps to shift the axis of its advance northeastward toward Prokhorovka...By attacking through Prokhorovka, Hoth was convinced that the stillp-powerful SS corps, with concentrated air support, could smash the armored threat to its east, unlock the advance of the III Panzer Corps, and open a new, albeit longer, approach route to the ky city of Kursk."(Glantz 146). This view was incorrect, and in doing so would put the final nail in the coffin of Operation Citadel. 

The supposedly decisive tank battle of Prokhorovka has been greatly dramatized and overblown in the historical narrative of the battle, and its importance was less in the number of tank duels that took place but as the final resting place of the German advance. While large parts of the 5th Guards Army, and more importantly the 5th Guards Tank Army were closing in on the Prokhorovka region, the battle was almost already run due to Soviet numerical superiority. As both sides closed in on the fields of Prokhorovka, both sides launched offensive operations against the other: turning what could have been a somewhat "setpiece" battle with both sides wielding fearsome spears of armored columns into a swirling clash. At the end of the first day of battle, according to Glantz, "Although Leibstandarte[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler] had made considerable progress and taken Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2, its panzer group was unable to advance beyond the state farm and found itself in a precarious position with both of its flanks exposed and subject to heavy fire."(Glantz 174). This was indicative of the nature of attacking the numerically superior and deeply entrenched Soviet forces at Kursk, and even more so at Prokhorovka where large Soviet formations were in-residence. However, Leibstandarte's costly thrust had, in Glantz's words, "irreperably smashed the 2d Tank Corps' defenses, isolated the corps' 99th Tank Brigade...and carved a deep salient in the 9th Guards Airborne Divsion's defenses forward of Prokhorovka. More significantly, the German hthrust had wholly preempted the 5th Guards Army's careful counterattack plans."(Glantz 175). In making a costly, and somewhat ill-advised advance into the entrenched positions of the 5th Guards Army, the Germans had unknowningly thrown the Soviets off balance. The showdown of Prokhorvka dawned on the 12th July, Hausser's divisions jumped off into the defensive positions of 5th Guard's Army right as they attacked. The superior Tiger Tanks, fewer in number but superior in gunnery and armor, clashed with dozens of T-34s intent on outflanking them. While the exchange ratio was favorable to the Germans all across the front, they did take losses and the loss of momentum ended any hope of a German breakthrough. Vicious fighting continued throughout the day, but nowhere did the Germans manage to find a decisive victory and get to open ground. The Soviet counteroffensive had launched at the same time the Germans had, and waves of T-34 tanks simply swept south through the exhausted Germans.
