### The Battle Of Kursk by David Glantz Book Report

The "Battle of Kursk" by David Glantz is an in-depth look at the greater political, strategic and operational context of the Battle of Kursk in 1943, an essential turning point in the Eastern Front of World War II. Glantz's look at the battle is unique in that it is not a narrative history, telling the story of the battle from the perspective of those on the ground and stitching them together into a coherent narrative. Instead, Glantz takes an analytical approach to the battle, looking at the battle from the top down and analyzing the different combatants's actions and decisions. This approach allows Glantz to provide a more comprehensive look at the battle, and to achieve a more nuanced view of the battle and the considerations that went into it. In this approach, Glantz goes out of his way to debunk many of the myths and misconceptions that have grown up around the battle, challenging popular narratives around reasons for the attack, why the Soviets won, and the role of individual actions across the front.  

Starting almost immediately, Glantz goes to great lengths to set up the stakes of the Battle of Kursk. Despite its smaller role in the history books compared to battles around Moscow and Stalingrad, both sides wagered a great deal on their operations in the Kursk area. Despite having little political or economic value, and little strategic value outside of the stretching of both armies' lines, the elimination of the Kursk salient was required to restore control of the front lines for the Germans and was a key in exploiting German weakness for the Soviets. The Germans absolutely needed a win at Kursk in order to boost flagging morale and whittle down the Soviet forces, which by this point were numerically superior in men and equipment. The Soviets were committed at Kursk because of the belief that the Germans were on the verge of total collapse, and that a victory at Kursk would grind down the German forces enough for massive Soviet offensives to follow much more easily. In Glantz's words, "Under the circumstances it was politically impossible for Germany to surrender the initiative on the Eastern Front. Although only fanatics believed that the Soviets could be decisively defeated, most senior leaders recognized the necessity for a renewed offensive."(Glantz 21). If the Germans rolled the dice and lost large portions of their army, the Soviets would be in a position to take the initiative and push the Germans back to the gates of Berlin.  

In the preparation phase of the battle, Glantz dispels the narrative that Hitler's meddling in pushing the attack from early May to July 5th due to his anxiety about the potential ramifications was singlehandedly responsible for the German defeat in the battle. Had Hitler believed in the superiority of his armies around the Kursk salient, as his original order implies, "This attack is of the utmost importance. It must be executed quickly. It must seize the initiative for us in the spring and summer. Therefore all preparations must be conducted with great circumspection and enterprise. The best formations, the best weapons, the best commanders and great stocks of ammunition must be committed in the main effort.. The enemy will be given no respite and will be destroyed by the prompt compression of the pocket."(Glantz 23), then a victory on the largely unprepared Soviets would have been assured, or so goes the historical narrative. This could not have been farther from the truth. Both armies were considerably weakened following the Battle of Stalingrad, and the Soviet offensives that created the Kursk salient. It would be irresponsible for any student of history to state that both the Soviets and Germans were in-shape for a confrontation the size of the Battle of Kursk, both sides needed time to recover and reorganize.
